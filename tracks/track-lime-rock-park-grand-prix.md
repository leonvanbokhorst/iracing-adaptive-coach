# Lime Rock Park – The Bullring

**Character**: High-Commitment Momentum Gym

## Background

Lime Rock Park is a deceptive little beast. On paper, it looks simple: 1.5 miles, 7 corners, mostly right-handers. In reality, it is one of the most intense, high-commitment tracks in North America. There are no "rest" zones here. The straights are short, the corners are fast, and the walls are close. It is often described as a "Bullring" for road racers—short, loud, and requiring constant aggression.

Uniquely, it has no long braking zones. This means passing is difficult and usually requires forcing an error or executing a brave move into Big Bend. For the FF1600, this track is a momentum test. Scrub too much speed in Big Bend or the Uphill, and you will be punished all the way to the next corner.

## Corner Reference

| Turn      | Name                       | Notes                                                          |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T1-T2** | Big Bend                   | Long double-apex right. Momentum critical.                     |
| **T3-T4** | The Esses                  | Left-Right complex. Precision required.                        |
| **T5**    | The Uphill                 | Fast right with a crest. "The Launchpad".                      |
| **T6**    | West Bend                  | Fast right. Setting up the back section.                       |
| **T7**    | The Downhill (Diving Turn) | Fast right leading to main straight. Exit speed is everything. |

## Sector Definitions (iRacing)

| Sector | Approx Time  | Corners                              | Key Challenge                        |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **S1** | ~14s (24%)   | Start/Finish → Big Bend (T1-T2)      | Brake timing & momentum preservation |
| **S2** | ~14.5s (25%) | The Esses (T3-T4) → No Name Straight | Precision & exit speed               |
| **S3** | ~9s (15%)    | The Uphill (T5)                      | Car placement & bravery (crest!)     |
| **S4** | ~20s (36%)   | West Bend (T6) → Diving Turn (T7)    | Flow & setup for the main straight   |

> **Note:** S1 (Big Bend) sets the tone. S3 (Uphill) requires trust. S4 (Downhill/Diving Turn) defines your top speed.

## Character Notes

- **The Rhythm**: Lime Rock has a heartbeat. It's fast-fast-fast. There is no "stop-and-go" rhythm here.
- **The Crests**: The Uphill is famous for launching cars. In the FF1600, you might not catch air, but the suspension unloads significantly.
- **The "No Name" Straight**: It has no name, but it determines if you can attack into the Uphill.
- **Right-Hand Bias**: It's almost entirely right turns. Left-side tires will cool down; right-side tires will scream.

## Ray FF1600 at Lime Rock

- **Momentum is King**: With low horsepower, every km/h scrubbed in Big Bend is lost forever.
- **Big Bend Strategy**: It's a double-apex (or late apex) corner. Don't rush the entry. Let the car roll.
- **The Uphill**: In the Ray, you can often take more speed than you think. Trust the downforce (what little there is) and the mechanical grip.
- **The Downhill (Diving Turn)**: Crucial for the run to the line. A poor exit here costs you time for the entire length of the Sam Posey Straight.

## Track Guide

You’re basically being coached into one theme: **momentum + minimal steering + “white line, not curb” discipline**. Lime Rock in the FF1600 is less “attack” and more “don’t sabotage the car’s exit speed with impatience.”

### Global rules (repeat these in your helmet like a cult chant)

- **Aim for white lines, not the concrete/inside curbs** (coach is explicit: don’t touch the unpainted concrete, don’t touch inside curbs at T1/T2, T6, last corner).
- **Minimal steering angle on exits** = free acceleration. If you’re adding steering, you’re scrubbing speed and the car hates you back.
- **One slow-down / one throttle commit** where possible (T1/T2 especially).
- **Downshifts are balance tools** in this car, not “because racecar.” Rush them and you’ll over-slow + destabilize the rear.

---

## Turn 1–2 (Big Bend) = "one corner, two apexes"

**Goal:** brake once, rotate early, **maintenance throttle** through the middle, full throttle once.

**Approach**

- Brake at **~2 board** (or slightly after, "2 board or less").
- **Turn-in a fraction BEFORE braking**, then brush brake: the car starts rotating immediately.

**Braking**

- **Short + decisive** brake pressure. Stab it, don't drag it.
- Downshift to **3rd quickly**.
- Delay **2nd gear** until **T1 apex or just after**. Big blip helps stability.
  (If you grab 2nd early, engine braking slows you too much and makes the rear nervous.)

**Line**

- **Do not touch the curb**. Aim for the **white line** at both apexes.
- Between the apexes, let the car run **more than half track width**. Don't stay tight. Tight mid means understeer + garbage exit.

**Throttle**

- ⚠️ **No coasting!** After braking, immediately go to **10-20% throttle** to settle the rear. This is "maintenance throttle"—not accelerating, just keeping the car balanced.
- Be **100% throttle 2–3 car lengths before T2 apex**.
- Track out using exit curb, but **don't drop a wheel into grass**; shallow-ish exit helps setup for T3.

**If you mess it up**

- If you're "on/off/on/off" throttle: you probably **over-braked or didn't carry entry speed**. Next lap: commit to higher entry, one smooth throttle application.

---

## Turn 3 (Left Hook) (and setting up T4)

**Goal:** light brake to rotate, miss the first apex slightly, nail the late apex, full throttle by late apex.

**Setup**

- After T2 exit, get back **to at least mid-track** before turning in. More rightward makes T3 less tight and saves T4.

**Braking**

- Wait a beat, then **gentle brush** brakes **2–3 car lengths later than you think** (coach wants it delayed).
- Use **very little pressure**: just enough to loosen rear and load front.
- Downshift **once to 2nd**, blip it.

**Line**

- First apex is “sort of imaginary”: **miss it** by **0.25–0.5 m** from the white line.
- Let it run a bit wide, then **late apex the second apex** and you _can_ really use that curbing there.

**Throttle**

- Be progressive to avoid understeer, but target **full throttle by the second apex** (or very close).
- On exit, stay **near the left-side white line** (within ~1–1.5 m). That’s your ticket to a comfortable flat T4.

---

## Turn 4 (Right-hander) = flat, but _comfortably_ flat

**Goal:** flat-out with low steering angle. Comfortable = fast.

- Stay flat always, even early stint.
- Aim for **white line**, **don’t touch curb**.
- Track out and use exit curb heavily, but your real KPI is: **how little steering** you needed.
  If you’re sawing at the wheel, you’re “flat” but slow.

**If you can’t keep it flat**

- The fix is almost never “try harder.” It’s usually: you exited T3 too far right, or you went to throttle too abruptly and induced understeer.

---

## Turn 5 (The Chicane / Uphill Entry)

**Goal:** minimal braking (lift is often enough), quick rotation through the R-L-R, stay in 2nd, commit to throttle early for the climb.

**The Setup**

- Angle the car outward so you can approach **dead straight**.
- Mount the **entry curb** before turning.

**Braking / Lifting**

- ⚠️ **Less brake than you think.** The hill and compression will scrub speed naturally.
- **Ideal**: Lift off throttle, light brush of brake (10-20% max) to shift weight forward, then turn.
- **If you're braking hard here, you're over-slowing.** The VRS alien brakes for only 15% of this section—you're at 22%. Trust the hill.

**The key trick: use the compression**

- The uphill transition loads the front tires naturally. You get "free" grip from the compression.
- Don't waste this by panic-braking. Let physics do the work.

**Release + turn**

- Release brake **quickly** and commit to the steering. Trail too long and you'll lose the rear or lock the front.

**Gears**

- **Do NOT go to 1st.** Stay in **2nd** (one downshift from 3rd).

**Curbs**

- Use curbing, but **avoid red anti-cut** (applies through the chicane).

**Throttle**

- As soon as you hit that first apex and rotation is done: **commit to full throttle quickly**. Power up the hill BEFORE the crest. This is free lap time.

**The Crest**

- The car will get light over the crest. Stay committed—don't lift.
- Apex the crest at the **white line only**, no curb.
- Track out using basically **all** exit curb. Leave almost no margin.

---

## Turn 6 (West Bend) = momentum corner, not a stopping corner

**Goal:** brush the brake to shift weight, get back on power quickly, set up the Diving Turn.

- **No downshift**. Stay in **4th**.
- **Turn in, then brush the brake** (10% max pressure)—just enough to load the front. You are NOT slowing down here; you are rotating.
- Get back on throttle **immediately** after the brush. Don't coast.
- Apex: **white line only**, no curb.
- Exit: use the curb, but your real goal is to be **set up wide for T7**.

**If you're braking hard here**

- You're killing the run to the Diving Turn. West Bend is a **flow corner**, not a stopping corner.

---

## Turn 7 (The Diving Turn / Downhill) = Exit is EVERYTHING

**Goal:** sacrifice entry if needed, be 100% throttle BEFORE the compression apex.

This corner sets your top speed on the main straight. A poor exit here costs you time for the ENTIRE length of the Sam Posey Straight. It is the single most important corner on the track.

**The Mindset**

- Stop looking at the exit curb. **Look at the Start/Finish line.**
- This is not about carrying max entry speed. This is about **max exit speed**.

**Braking / Entry**

- Late-ish lift, precise turn-in.
- The compression at the bottom gives you grip. Use it.
- If you're not confident, **go slower in and nail the exit**. The time is on the straight, not in the corner.

**Throttle (THE KEY)**

- Be at **100% throttle 1–2 car lengths BEFORE the apex**.
- The compression loads the rear tires—this is your launch window.
- ⚠️ **If you're still at 80% throttle at the apex, you've already lost.** The reference driver is 2.8 km/h faster at exit. That's 8+ km/h by the time you reach T1.

**Line**

- Surgical precision. Even **0.25–0.5 m wide** kills grip and delays throttle.
- Avoid inside curb; apex = **white line**.
- Exit: use all curb, and **unwind the steering as fast as possible**. Less steering = more acceleration.

### Three "self-coaching" checks (so you don't need to guess)

Quick sanity tests while driving:

- **T1/T2:** Did you have exactly one throttle commit (with maintenance throttle in the middle)? If you're on/off/on, your entry was wrong (usually too much brake or grabbed 2nd too early).
- **T5 (Chicane):** Did you brake hard or just lift + brush? If your foot was heavy on the brake, you over-slowed. The hill does the work.
- **T7 (Diving Turn):** Were you at 100% throttle BEFORE the apex? If not, you left time on the main straight. This is the biggest lap time lever.

## Practice Cues for the Week

1.  **T1 "Stab & Steer"**: Stop dragging the brake in Big Bend. Brake later, brake shorter (quick scrub), and get back on 10-20% throttle immediately to settle the rear. No coasting!
2.  **T3 Precision (The Esses)**: "Hug the Left." You are missing the T3 apex and sawing the wheel. Sacrifice entry speed to paint the left curb. This sets up T4 and the No Name Straight. One smooth steering input only.
3.  **T5 "Trust the Compression"**: NO BRAKES at the Uphill entry. You are panic-braking (80%) where you should be flying. Lift only, turn in, and let the hill scrub the speed. Power up before the crest. The compression gives you super-grip—use it!
4.  **T6 "Brush & Go"**: West Bend is a momentum corner, not a stopping corner. Drive deeper, brush the brake (max 10% pressure just to shift weight), and get back on power. You are braking 25% and killing the run to the Downhill.
5.  **T7 "Exit is Everything"**: The Downhill sets up the main straight. Sacrifice entry to be 100% throttle BEFORE the compression apex. Look at the Start/Finish line, not the exit curb. Your late throttle is costing 8 km/h down the straight.

## Personal Notes

> _"It's not a crash, it's just aggressive landscaping."_

### Week 04 – January 2026 (Season 01)

**First Discovery:** "The Aggression Gap." The difference isn't the car—it's commitment. Shuning Gong is full throttle 72% of the lap; I'm at 63%. They brake at 92%; I brake at 66%.

**The Feel:** Frantic. 12 incidents in the baseline session. The car feels unsettled over the crests.

**Specific Challenges:**

- **T5 (Uphill)**: Panic-braking where I should be lifting. Braking 22% of the section vs alien's 15%.
- **T7 (Diving Turn)**: Late throttle killing exit speed. -2.8 km/h at exit = -8 km/h by T1.
- **Braking Technique**: Too gentle. Dragging brakes instead of stabbing them.

**The Breakthrough:** (Pending - Need to trust the compression and commit to throttle earlier).

### Overtaking

- **Big Bend (T1) Inside**: The classic spot. Requires a good run out of the Downhill.
- **The Uphill (T5)**: Only for the brave. Not recommended in Rookies.
- **West Bend**: Possible if the car ahead makes a mistake in the Uphill.
