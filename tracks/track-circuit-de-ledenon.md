# Circuit de Lédenon – Rollercoaster in a Bowl

Circuit de Lédenon grew out of a slightly mad idea: Jean-Claude and Sylvie Bondurand carving a permanent circuit into the hills north-east of Nîmes in the early 1970s.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_L%C3%A9denon">Circuit de Lédenon — Wikipedia</a></sup> What they ended up with is one of France’s most undulating tracks, wrapped inside a natural bowl and run the “wrong” way round for the country: anti-clockwise, thirteen corners, and almost no moment when the car isn’t loaded up.

On paper, 3.151 km doesn’t sound intimidating.<sup><a href="https://www.iracing.com/tracks/circuit-de-ledenon/">Circuit de Lédenon — iRacing.com</a></sup> In the cockpit it’s something else entirely: blind crests, off-camber entries, downhill braking zones and a main “straight” that climbs so hard it feels like you’re driving up the side of the amphitheatre. Small mistakes here don’t vanish; they hang around for half a lap.

This is a track that divides drivers. The first few sessions can feel claustrophobic and chaotic. Once you learn to look _past_ the next crest and trust the car over the blind rises, it turns into one of those circuits that makes you grin and swear in the same breath.

## Character Notes

- **Anti-clockwise anomaly** – Long sequences of medium-speed lefts test your weaker side as a driver. Your neck, your hands and even your brake references feel subtly “wrong-handed” until your body catches up.
- **Elevation as a weapon** – Lédenon uses height like other tracks use chicanes. Crests hide apexes; compressions spike grip; the uphill pit straight punishes anyone who exits the last complex even slightly compromised.
- **Rhythm track, not point-and-squirt** – There are very few true straights. Many “corners” are really parts of one long, undulating arc. If you attack each bend as an isolated event, the car feels busy and nervous. If you string them into three or four big shapes, the lap suddenly calms down.
- **Commitment in the blind** – Several key braking zones and turn-ins are over brows or into off-camber landings. If you wait to see everything before you commit, you’re late on every input. The trick is learning references you can see _before_ the crest and trusting them.

## Ray FF1600 at Lédenon

The Ray feels almost purpose-built for this place: light, honest, and completely at the mercy of momentum.

- **Bias & braking**  
  **Expert recommendation: 57% brake bias.** This forward bias keeps the rear settled through the downhill braking zones and compression corners (La cuvette, T14) where the rear can snap if you're trailing brakes at the wrong moment. As you gain confidence, adjust to taste—but 57% is the proven baseline for the Ray here.

- **Lines through the “rollercoaster”**  
  Think in sequences, not corners. The long left section after the first chicane and the plunge down into the Camion / Cavalet area work best when you choose one early, wide entry and then let the Ray take a single, patient arc down the hill. If you try to “correct” mid-sequence with extra steering, you bleed speed and upset the balance.

- **Throttle over the crests**  
  The Ray responds beautifully to a held, partial throttle as you crest into a blind section. A little pedal keeps weight on the rear and stops the car from feeling floaty. Only when the road “arrives” under you again do you feed in full power. Big, binary on/off stabs here are an easy way to discover the limits of iRacing’s tow system.

- **Kerbs and camber**  
  Some apex kerbs at Lédenon are tall and serrated; others are flatter and safe. In the FF1600, treat apex kerbs with suspicion in off-camber or downhill corners: touching them while the car is light can flick you off-line. Exit kerbs on the uphill sections are your friends—use them to let the car run and preserve momentum up the hill.

- **Racecraft here**  
  Without big straights, passes tend to be built over several corners. In the Ray, your best moves come from better exits onto the climbing main “straight” or from being braver—but still smooth—into the downhill braking zones. Divebombs almost always turn into shared trips to the gravel; patient pressure forces mistakes far more reliably.

## Corner-by-Corner Technique (Ray FF1600)

### Triple Gauche (T1–T3)

**The setup:** Open WIDE beyond the white line on entry. Turn in just before the elevated Marshall's post on the right.

**The key:** DELAY the single downshift to 3rd as long as possible. The delayed downshift keeps the car stable, reduces engine braking, and lets you carry more entry speed. Blip the throttle to further stabilize on downshift.

**Linking the apexes:** Clip both first and second apex curves. Only use brakes if the car needs rotation to make the next apex — react to what the car does, don't trail brake preemptively. Coast between apexes if possible.

**T3 exit:** Brief throttle after second apex to get wide, then turn in LATE, apex LATE. Get to full throttle before the apex. Use all the curb and the concrete inside — it's rarely wheelspin if setup is right.

### T4

Flat out. Scrub front tires as little as possible. Straight line.

### La Carrierasse (T5) — Downhill Braking

**Brake reference:** Two car lengths past the kink in the white line.

**The trick:** Point the car INWARDS while braking — diagonal approach. This cuts distance and gets you onto the banked inner pavement sooner.

**Trail braking:** Trail heavily on entry but don't overdo it — easy to lose the rear. Single downshift to 2nd. Hug the white line but DON'T touch the curb (negates the banking advantage).

**Exit:** Aggressive throttle — compression helps. Stay on the pavement up to the white line. Going wider adds distance and loses the banking.

### La Courmelle (T6)

**The approach:** Exaggerate late turn-in, late apex. Brake 4–5 car lengths past the small kink in white line. Use track width beyond white line on entry.

**The apex:** Only use the PAINTED part of the curb. Concrete triggers wheelspin. Focus on how early and cleanly you get back to full throttle. Even if you technically miss the apex, a clean throttle application saves the corner.

**Track limit:** Outer edge of exit curb.

### T7

Flat out. Use curb and concrete.

### Virage du Camion (T8) — High Speed Right

**The commitment:** Use all track width on entry. Stay flat out DEEP into the entry — release throttle well after turning in.

**The technique:** NO DOWNSHIFT. Stay in 4th gear. Release throttle QUICKLY and ABRUPTLY — all rotation comes from the throttle lift, not brakes. Snappy lift = more rotation.

**Apex:** Use all curbing plus the pavement inside the painted curb. Full throttle a bit beyond apex. Don't push too wide or you'll pick up off-track.

### La cuvette (T9) — THE Compression Corner ⚠️

**This corner bites if you don't understand the compression.**

**Brake reference:** As soon as the car is parallel to the curbing at track edge. Brake EARLIER than you expect — easy to outbrake yourself.

**The setup:** Keep the car fairly wide on entry. Two downshifts to 2nd gear.

**THE KEY — Compression physics:**
The MASSIVE compression at the apex is both gift and danger. If you're still heavily on brakes with lots of steering angle when you hit the compression, the front suddenly grips and the rear doesn't → SNAPPY OVERSTEER.

**The fix:** Be "slightly underdriving" before the compression. Light with steering and braking inputs as you approach it. Get on throttle EARLY — this shifts weight to the rear and stabilizes the car.

**Target:** 100% throttle RIGHT at the heart of the compression. DON'T touch the inside curb (it messes with the compression grip). Track out to exit curb but not beyond — wider isn't faster.

### La servie (T10) — Flat Out Commitment

**The surprise:** This corner is FLAT OUT. No braking, no lift.

**Turn-in reference:** A couple car lengths before the tire barrier starts (apex is blind).

**Execution:** Mount the apex curb aggressively. Run wide all the way to the braking point for T11.

### Le Cavalet (T11) — Brake Late or Lose Time

**The approach:** Brake VERY LATE — right on the verge of outbraking yourself. This is the only way to get a competitive exit.

**Line:** Wide approach, late turn-in, late apex. Rotate the car significantly before the apex.

**Gear:** Stay in 2nd (NOT 1st). Second gear gives stability on entry and prevents wheelspin at the apex.

**Curb warning:** Don't cut onto the concrete or paved runoff inside — triggers wheelspin.

**Throttle:** Start applying before apex, full throttle about a car length after.

### T12

Flat out. Cut the apex significantly.

### T13 — Braking While Turning

**Brake reference:** Start of the gravel trap on the outside.

**The technique:** Ramp up brake pressure SLOWLY — you're still turning through this braking zone. Wait until steering is completely straight before peak threshold braking.

**Line:** Cut the T13 apex aggressively. Use all the curb and green paint.

### T14 — Final Corner (Compression Danger v2) ⚠️

**Same compression danger as La cuvette, but MORE exaggerated.**

The compression here is even more aggressive. Front hits compression first → sudden front grip, no rear grip → guaranteed rear loss if still trailing brakes.

**The fix:** Slow the car enough on entry to apply throttle BEFORE the compression. Throttle settles the rear.

**Apex:** DON'T touch inside curbing. Full throttle just past apex. Track limit is outer edge of exit curb.

### T15

Tight trajectory to cut distance. Long run to the line.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Use Lédenon as your “eyes up and trust the reference” lab.

- **Day 1 – Map the rollercoaster**  
  Run slow laps and literally name the features out loud: “crest, off-camber, downhill brake, compression.” The goal isn’t speed; it’s giving your brain a clear mental model of what the terrain is doing so your fear response doesn’t have to guess.

- **Day 2 – One sequence at a time**  
  Pick a section (for example, the plunge into the bowl and back out) and drive it as if it were one giant corner. Keep your hands quiet, throttle breathing, and see how early you can commit to a line without mid-corner corrections.

- **Race runs – Rhythm over aggression**  
  In races, let Lédenon teach you patience. Choose one or two corners where you’ll _never_ send a move (high-risk downhill zones), and one or two where you allow yourself to attack after proper setup. If you finish a race feeling like you “surfed” the track more than you fought it, you’re doing it right.
