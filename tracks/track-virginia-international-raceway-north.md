# VIR North Course – The Dancing Circuit

When VIR was resurrected in 2000, it didn't just bring back the legendary Full Course; it came back as a modular playground. The 2.25-mile North Course is basically a "best of VIR" mixtape, stitching together the Horseshoe, the Snake, the Climbing Section, Roller Coaster and Hog Pen into one condensed lap.

It shares the front section with the Full Course (Horseshoe through Snake), then takes a connector up the hill instead of going through South Bend/Oak Tree/Back Straight, rejoining at Roller Coaster.

On paper, North is just a trimmed Full Course. In the car it's intense: medium-speed complexes, big elevation swings (over 100 feet from lowest to highest), blind crests and no real "relax" sectors. It's one of those layouts where, if you're not slightly ahead of the car mentally, the track will put you there physically.

## Sector Definitions (iRacing)

| Sector | Approx Time | Corners | Key Challenge |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **S1** | ~24.7s (27%) | T1 Horseshoe → T2 → T3 NASCAR Bend | Trail braking T1, sacrifice T4 |
| **S2** | ~19.5s (21%) | T4-T6 Link → Snake → T7 Uphill | T4 sacrifice, compression timing |
| **S3** | ~28.2s (31%) | T8-T9 → T10-T11 Climbing → Roller Coaster | Biggest variance zone, blind crests |
| **S4** | ~19.3s (21%) | T12-T13 Hog Pen → T14 → Finish | Rotation lift, compression throttle |

> **Note:** S3 is the longest and highest-variance sector. The climbing section (T8-T11) and Roller Coaster approach are where lap time is made or lost.

## Character Notes

- **Compressed VIR** – Horseshoe, Snake, Climbing Section, Roller Coaster, Hog Pen—arranged in a tight loop.
- **Elevation as drama** – The Climbing Section and the drop through Roller Coaster/Hog Pen use vertical load as much as lateral. The car is constantly either digging into the hill or going light over a brow.
- **Flow over fragments** – North doesn't reward thinking in single corners. The Snake into the Climbing Section, and Roller Coaster into Hog Pen, are sequences that only make sense if you drive them as one big thought.
- **Old-school edges** – Grass, walls, earth banks. Go a metre too far at the end of Hog Pen or over-commit in the Climbing Section and the circuit reminds you it's been around since the '50s.

## Ray FF1600 EXPERT Guide

Source: Expert coach lap guide  
**BB Setting: 55-56%** (critical for preventing front lockups at T1)

### T1 - Horseshoe (Decreasing Radius)

**Braking:**
- Reference: "2" board on outside
- Cold tires: brake AT the board (or slightly earlier)
- Warm tires: can go **1.5 car lengths past** the board
- DON'T go deeper — easy to lock up and miss apex

**Technique:**
- Brake in **straight line** at edge of track
- Turn in **EARLY** but apex **LATE**
- Entry speed determines apex, not turn-in point
- Release brakes **slowly and gradually**
- Car rear WILL move — be ready to catch it
- Downshift to 1st, blip throttle for last two downshifts (stability)

**Apex:** Just before end of painted curb (avoid bumpy second section)

**Exit:** 
- 100% throttle as you approach end of curbing
- **DON'T use outer half of track** — stay 1-2 car widths from inside
- This cuts distance significantly

---

### T2 (Transition)

- Stay inside, don't use full track width
- Distance savings matter here

---

### T3 - NASCAR Bend (Double Apex Left)

**First apex:** FLAT OUT, miss deliberately by **full car width**

**Setup:** By braking start, be in **middle of road** (not all the way out)

**Braking:**
- Start at end of first apex curb
- **Light inputs** — easy to lose rear
- **NO downshift** — stay in 3rd

**Second apex:** Fully mount curb, get aggressive

**Throttle:** Be **gradual** — quick throttle = understeer = pushed wide

**Exit:** Use all curbing AND green painted runoff

---

### T4 - Left Hook (SACRIFICE CORNER)

> "This corner is not really important compared to what comes next"

**Braking:** 1-2 car lengths before shiny patch on track

**KEY INSIGHT:** Slow MORE than necessary → sets up T5-T6 flat out

**Technique:**
- Turn in **late**, apex **late**
- Only track out to **middle of road** (not full width)
- Downshift once to 2nd
- Fully mount curb

---

### T5-T6 - The Payoff (FLAT OUT)

**Goal:** Stay flat because you sacrificed T4

**Line:**
- Fully mount both apexes
- **DON'T run too wide** between apexes
- Tighter line = smoother radius = less steering = faster
- Minimize sliding and tire scrub

**Exit T6:** Fully mount curbs, keep wheel straight for acceleration

---

### T7 - Uphill Compression Entry (Like T1)

**Braking:** ~1 car length before white line straightens out on outside

**KEY INSIGHT:** Turn in early to enter **uphill compression SOONER** = more grip for longer

**Technique:**
- Turn in **EARLY**, apex **LATE** (same as T1)
- Trail brake initially BUT...
- **STOP trail braking in compression** — too much front grip = easy rear loss
- Pick up throttle **before** late apex

**Apex:** Don't touch inside curb, aim for **white line**

**Exit:** 
- Don't use full track width
- Stay off **off-camber outer section** (scrubs speed)

---

### T8-T9 - Uphill (FLAT OUT)

- Use curb AND even grass before access road
- **Use the access road** to widen entry to T10 (makes huge difference)

---

### T10 - Chicane Entry

**KEY INSIGHT:** Early throttle lift, not late/deep

**Technique:**
- Turn in early
- Lift throttle **right after turning** (not deep in corner)
- Smaller lift = preserve speed + return to throttle sooner

**Apex:** All concrete curb, only **half** of painted curb (bumpy)

**Throttle:** Careful over bumps — easy to lose rear

---

### T11 - Chicane Exit

**LINE:** Aim for curb **AND grass** on inside — helps rotate car

**Technique:**
- Early throttle lift (right after direction change)
- Only **30-40% lift** through here
- Full throttle as soon as you reach pavement

**Warning:** Don't run wide — tire scrub matters (3rd gear + steep hill = poor acceleration)

---

### T12-T13 - Top of Hill

- Fully mount curb at T13
- Keep corner as straight as possible (minimize scrub)
- Set up for T14 (move fully left)

---

### T14 - Roller Coaster (BLIND + TRICKY)

> "One of the trickier corners of the entire lap"

**Why it's hard:**
- Completely blind
- Downhill entry AND exit
- No grip, car always pushes wide

**REVERSE ENGINEERING TECHNIQUE:**
1. Exit has understeer (downhill + off-camber)
2. Therefore: need **late, gradual throttle**
3. To justify late throttle: **brake later + carry more entry speed**
4. Result: understeer doesn't feel as bad

**Braking:** 
- **4 car lengths** before end of entry curb
- Turn in **early** (anticipate understeer)
- Downshift once to 2nd

**Trail braking:** 
- **Continue trailing** — otherwise car doesn't turn at all
- (Opposite of T7 compression!)

**Apex:** Don't touch elevated green/yellow painted curb — stay on flat concrete

**Throttle:** **Gradual and patient** — only way to prevent understeer and stay off grass

---

### T15 - Transition (FLAT OUT)

- Avoid bumpy curb (causes sliding)

---

### T16-T17 - Hog Pen (Final Complex)

#### T16 Entry

**Line:** Use full track width, turn in at end of entry curb

**KEY TECHNIQUE:** 
- **Subtle throttle lift** to rotate car (don't stay flat!)
- Lift until nose points **parallel to curb** (far left)
- This opens up T17

#### T16 Apex

- Mount curb
- Release throttle fully
- At **end of painted curb**: turn in + brush brakes simultaneously
- No downshift — stay in 3rd

#### T16-T17 Transition

- Cut over grass on inside (limit: **half car beyond curb = off track**)
- Sets up T17 entry

#### T17 Apex

**KEY:** Compression at apex — **USE IT**

- Full throttle **at the compression**
- Use flat concrete curb (not painted)
- Let car run wide to second apex — **don't fight understeer**
- Keep steering **straight** for efficient acceleration

**Exit:** Run wide to exit curb, stay slightly inside through long run to S/F

## Key Patterns Summary

| Corner | Trail Brake? | Why |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| T1 | Yes, slow release | Long corner, needs rotation |
| T7 | NO in compression | Too much front grip = rear loss |
| T14 | YES, continue | Only way car turns (downhill) |
| T17 | Light brush | Just to settle car |

| Corner | Apex | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| T1 | LATE despite early turn-in | Entry speed pushes wide |
| T3 | Miss first, hit second | Setup corner |
| T4 | LATE | Sacrifice for T5-T6 |
| T7 | LATE | Like T1, plus compression timing |
| T14 | Late-ish | Carrying entry speed |

| Corner | Track Width on Exit |
|--------|---------------------|
| T1 | **Half** — stay inside |
| T3 | Full + runoff |
| T4 | **Middle only** |
| T7 | **Not full** — avoid off-camber |
| T14 | Careful — understeer |
| T17 | Full |

## Practice Drills

### Drill 1: T4 Sacrifice → T5-T6 Flat Out

**EXPERT insight**: T4 is NOT important — slow MORE than necessary, apex late, only track out to middle
**Goal**: Exit T4 in position to stay FLAT through T5-T6
**Test**: Can you stay flat T5-T6? If not, sacrifice T4 more.

### Drill 2: T7 Compression Timing

**EXPERT insight**: Turn in early to enter compression sooner = more grip for longer
**Critical**: STOP trail braking in compression (too much front grip = rear loss)
**Goal**: Feel the moment compression takes over, release brakes there

### Drill 3: T14 Reverse Engineering

**EXPERT insight**: Exit understeer is inevitable → brake LATER + more entry speed → feels better
**Technique**: Continue trail braking through corner (only way it turns), patient throttle out
**Goal**: Carry speed, don't fight understeer on exit — just be gradual

### Drill 4: T16-T17 Rotation Lift

**EXPERT insight**: Subtle throttle lift at T16 rotates car — don't stay flat
**Technique**: Lift until nose points parallel to curb, then turn + brush brakes at end of painted curb
**Goal**: Use T17 compression for full throttle, let car run wide (don't fight)

## Personal Notes

> _First impressions and learnings. Worth revisiting next time I'm here._

### Week 08 – January 2026 (Season 1)

**First Discovery:** Full Course memory (80 laps, 2 years ago) transfers powerfully. 15/21 corners DIALED on first session (σ < 0.1s).

**The Feel:** Slippery surface, blind crests, bumps everywhere. Requires smoothness and anticipation. "It's flowy, it's a dancing circuit."

**VRS Gap Analysis (vs EXPERT):** 
- **Total gap:** ~3s
- **Biggest losses:** T2-3 (-0.546s), T1 (-0.357s), S6 (-0.277s)
- **T7-9 only -0.158s** — uphill section better than expected

**The Nemesis Corner:** T8a (Uphill Chicane) — σ 0.546s. This is the ONLY corner without Full Course equivalent.

**Tire Temps Revelation:**
- LF/LR outside hot = scrubbing in right-handers (track is left-biased)
- RF/RR inside hot = aggressive turn-in to lefts
- Pattern: overdriving entry on lefts, scrubbing exit on rights

**T7 Oversteer Pattern:** 1,064 oversteer events. EXPERT says stop trail braking in compression — data confirms brake release too slow.

**The Breakthrough (pending):** Need to commit harder to T1-T3. 0.9s sitting there waiting.

**Stats:** Baseline PB **1:31.517** (Lap 9), 10 flying laps, crashed Lap 10, immediate recovery.

### Overtaking (TBD)

_To be discovered in race conditions._
