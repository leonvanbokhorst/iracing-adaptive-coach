# Rudskogen Motorsenter – Forest Rollercoaster

Rudskogen opened in 1990 as Norway’s first permanent asphalt circuit, cut into the rocky pine forest south-east of Oslo.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudskogen">Rudskogen — Wikipedia</a></sup> In 2006 it became the country’s official national motorsport facility, and Hermann Tilke was brought in to stretch and sculpt it into the modern 3.254 km layout: 14 corners, a 640-metre straight and about 42 metres of elevation change packed into a tight forest bowl.<sup><a href="https://www.racingcircuits.info/europe/norway/rudskogen.html">Rudskogen — RacingCircuits.info</a></sup>

Today the same strip of tarmac hosts STCC and GT weekends, superkarts, drift events and police driver training. It’s very Scandinavian: one part high-speed theatre, one part very serious classroom.

_Track Guide: Rudskogen Motorsenter by Kaelan Jensen_

The Grand Prix lap feels like a rally stage that decided to become a circuit. Fast, loaded arcs that climb and plunge through the trees, awkwardly late apexes that only make sense once you’ve overshot them a few times, and braking zones that tilt _just_ enough to keep your ABS foot honest. The forest walls close in, turning the whole thing into a tunnel of rock, bark and Armco.

## Sector Definitions (iRacing)

| Sector | Approx Time | Corners                         | Key Challenge                                |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **S1** | ~26s (29%)  | T1-T3 → Uphill sweeper          | Uphill momentum, weight transfer             |
| **S2** | ~31s (35%)  | T4-T6 → Back straight & braking | **T2 downhill braking, trail brake mastery** |
| **S3** | ~17s (19%)  | T7-T11 → Middle bowl            | Flow through linked corners                  |
| **S4** | ~17s (19%)  | T12-T14 → Final sector          | Last corner exit onto main straight          |

> **Note:** S2 is the longest sector and contains the critical T2 downhill braking zone (tight hairpin right). Master Lonn's breakthrough came from finding the "50 sign" brake marker and mastering trail braking all the way through. If your S2 variance (σ) is high, focus on that specific corner—it's 73% of the lap time opportunity.

### Ray FF1600 Setup Guidance

**Brake Bias:** 52-56% recommended range

- **55%**: Sweet spot for Rudskogen (good rotation + stable braking)
- **56%**: Default (more stable, less rotation)
- **52-54%**: More rotation, higher risk of rear instability

Start at 55% and adjust in 0.5% increments. Move rearward until you feel first sign of rear instability on entry, then forward 0.2-0.3% to find your optimal balance.

### Lap Time Benchmarks

| Level                         | Time         | Gap to Master Lonn's Current PB |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Alien (Top 0.1%)**          | 1:26.799     | -2.892s                         |
| **Fast Driver (Top 5%)**      | ~1:28.066    | -1.197s                         |
| **Competitive (Rookie Goal)** | Sub-1:29.000 | +0.031s ✅                      |
| **Master Lonn July 2025 PB**  | 1:28.969     | Baseline                        |
| **Master Lonn Current Best**  | 1:29.691     | +0.722s                         |

> Master Lonn is currently in the **upper-intermediate/competitive** bracket, just 0.722s from his PB and already faster than "competitive rookie" goal. Gap to top-tier (1.2s) is technique + experience, not talent.

## Character Notes

- **Forest canyon** – Trees, rock faces and guardrails sit close, so your peripheral vision is always busy. It feels more like a hillclimb built on a loop than a wide-open GP circuit.
- **Elevation with attitude** – The climb through T3–T4 and the plunge into T6 define the lap. You’re braking and turning while the car is either still climbing or already falling, so weight transfer is never neutral.
- **Long arcs, late secrets** – Several corners are really long, bending sequences with late apexes hiding around the bend. If you turn in “where it looks right”, you arrive early and pay for it all the way down the next hill.
- **Scandi dual-purpose** – Some days it’s GTs and Porsches hanging it out at the edge; other days it’s police-training fleets and trackday heroes practising safe lines. The layout has to be fun _and_ educational—and it is.

## Ray FF1600 at Rudskogen

In the Ray FF1600, Rudskogen becomes a **momentum and bravery calibration tool**. You rarely sit still on the wheel; you’re either loading, releasing or catching the car.

- **T1–T3: opening the flow**  
  The first complex sets the tone. Turn 1 and the following kinks want calm, early inputs: brake a little sooner than you think, get the Ray pointed, and then let it _roll_ into the uphill right of T3. If you try to bully T3 with late braking and extra steering, you just bleed speed for the long climb that follows.

- **The uphill sweeper (T3/T4)**  
  This is one of the “hero corners”. In the Ray, you’re in the classic momentum dilemma: lift and lose time, or commit and trust the car. Start with a small, early lift and let the car take a wide, climbing line; as confidence grows, move that lift closer to turn-in and reduce its size. The car will take more mid-corner speed than your eyes initially believe—if your hands are quiet.

- **Back straight and T6 braking**  
  The 640 m straight is only as good as your exit onto it. A clean, unwound steering wheel before full throttle matters more than squeezing the last km/h out of the previous corner. Braking into T6 is uphill-then-downhill, so the car gets light just as you want max pedal. Get your big brake hit done while the chassis is still supported, then bleed off pressure as you crest so the rear doesn’t start to wander.

- **Middle bowl (T7–T11)**  
  This section is a flowing, medium-speed bowl where the Ray feels completely in its element. The trick is to think in shapes, not corners: one long, linking line through the left-rights, with the throttle breathing instead of stabbing. Over-drive one part and you spend the next two correcting; keep it smooth and the car just keeps pouring speed into the next kink.

- **Final sector and last stop**  
  The closing corners bring you back downhill with another important braking event. Fatigue plus falling elevation equals “just a bit too deep” lockups. In the Ray, give yourself the gift of a slightly earlier, straighter brake here and focus on one last clean exit. Over a race stint, the drivers who respect the last braking zone usually end up ahead of those who try to win the lap there.

- **Brake bias & crests**  
  Early in the week, a front-leaning bias (a couple of clicks towards safety) keeps the rear composed over the T6 and final braking crests. As tyre temps and your courage rise, nudging the bias back towards neutral lets the Ray rotate more willingly into the quicker direction changes—but every extra step rearward means you have to be even smoother when the road falls away.

## Corner-by-Corner Reference (Ray FF1600)

Quick reference for gear, target speed, and key technique notes per corner.

### Sector 1 (Start → Uphill)

| Corner | Type           | Gear | Target Min Speed         | Key Points                                                       |
| ------ | -------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T1** | Right          | 3rd  | 60-65 mph (97-105 km/h)  | Brake at 100m board, late apex for exit onto short straight      |
| **T2** | Left Kink      | 4th  | 85-95 mph (137-153 km/h) | Small lift only, brush apex curb, minimal steering               |
| **T3** | Right Downhill | 3rd  | 70-75 mph (113-121 km/h) | Light brake to settle car, late/shallow apex, avoid sausage curb |

### Sector 2 (Downhill Braking → Back Straight) **[CRITICAL]**

| Corner    | Type                    | Gear    | Target Min Speed           | Key Points                                                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T4/T5** | **Tight Hairpin Right** | **2nd** | **35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)** | **Brake at 100m/"50 sign", long trail brake to late apex, CRITICAL for lap time** |
| **T6**    | Fast Right Kink         | 4th     | 95-105 mph (153-169 km/h)  | Flat-out in Ray FF1600, avoid sausage curb                                        |

> **Master Lonn's T2/T5 Breakthrough:** "Brake way later downhill just before 50 sign, trail brake all the way through, 3rd on apex, 2nd just before hill to second apex." This transformed S2 from 0.75s σ to 0.32s σ - 2.3x more consistent!

### Sector 3 (Middle Bowl Flow)

| Corner  | Type              | Gear | Target Min Speed         | Key Points                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T7**  | Left Medium       | 3rd  | 60-65 mph (97-105 km/h)  | Small brake, late apex, don't attack inside curb           |
| **T8**  | Right Tight       | 2nd  | 45-50 mph (72-80 km/h)   | Brake at 80-90m, focus on rotation + clean exit            |
| **T9**  | Fast Right Uphill | 3rd  | 70-75 mph (113-121 km/h) | Lift/light brake over crest, blind apex - commit gradually |
| **T10** | Left Flick        | 4th  | 80-90 mph (129-145 km/h) | No brake or tiny lift, keep hands calm                     |

### Sector 4 (Carousel → Finish) **[CRITICAL EXIT]**

| Corner  | Type                       | Gear        | Target Min Speed             | Key Points                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **T11** | Carousel Right Entry       | 3rd         | 55-60 mph (89-97 km/h)       | Brake at 80-90m, long trail brake, critical for tire management       |
| **T12** | Carousel Mid               | 3rd         | 60-62 mph (97-100 km/h)      | Maintenance throttle + feather brake for balance, patience key        |
| **T13** | **Right Exit to Straight** | **3rd/4th** | **65-70 mph (105-113 km/h)** | **Tiny brake/lift, very late apex, CRITICAL - exit speed = lap time** |
| **T14** | S/F Kink                   | 4th         | Vmax                         | Flat out, stay predictable in traffic                                 |

> **Technique Reminder:** _"The magic is in the release. Aim for smooth 0.3-0.7s taper from max pressure to turn-in."_ Progressive brake release (trail braking) keeps weight over fronts and helps rotation.

## Practice Cues for the Week

Let Rudskogen be your **“forest flow” dojo** in the Ray.

- **Sector 1 & uphill sweeper drills**  
  Spend early sessions just looping the opening sector. Aim to get three consecutive laps where your minimum speed through the uphill right is within a tiny window and your steering input looks like one continuous sweep, not a series of corrections.

- **T6 braking repeatability**  
  Dedicate a stint purely to the T6 stop. Pick a marker you can see from inside the “tunnel” of trees—fence post, marshal box, change in armco colour—and practise braking at that exact point every lap. Watch for when the rear starts to feel light over the crest; that’s your cue to smooth out the pedal, not move it later.

- **Race runs in dirty air**  
  In longer runs, deliberately sit in someone’s wake through the bowl section. The Ray loses just enough front grip in dirty air to force you to be tidy: slightly earlier turn-ins, softer hands, and more patience on throttle. If you can keep your rhythm without a clean view of the apex, Rudskogen has really started to live in your body.

Once it clicks, Rudskogen stops feeling like an intimidating forest stage and starts feeling like a high-speed hiking trail you know by heart: you’re no longer wondering what’s behind the next crest—you’re already setting the car up for it.

## Personal Notes

> _First impressions and learnings. Worth revisiting next time I'm here._

### [Week 02 – December 2025](../weeks/week02/) (Season 01 2026 on iRacing)

**The Reunion:** Returning to Rudskogen after 6 months (last raced July 2025, same-series PB: **1:28.969**). Expected rust everywhere. Found it concentrated in ONE place: Turn 2.

**First Session – The Diagnosis (Dec 18):** 1:30.290, **σ = 1.43s**. Felt familiar immediately. S1, S3, S4 showed Jefferson-level consistency right away (σ = 0.22-0.40s). But S2? **0.96s loss per lap** (73% of total gap!), **σ = 0.75s** (swinging 30.8s → 32.4s). Master Lonn's instinct before seeing any data: _"Still looking for the correct turn-in and braking in T2."_ The data confirmed it perfectly.

**The T2 Breakthrough (Dec 20):** Found the complete answer in one focused session. Gap: **1.321s → 0.722s** (cut almost in half!). Best lap: **1:29.691** (first sub-1:30), **σ = 0.699s** (2x better). The breakthrough wasn't one thing—it was the COMPLETE corner sequence:

1. **Brake marker:** "50 sign" downhill (specific, visual, repeatable)
2. **Technique:** Trail brake all the way through (not lift, not coast)
3. **Gear sequence:** 3rd on apex → 2nd just before the hill to second apex
4. **Vision:** Looking ahead to the second apex on the hill (not tunneling on first apex)

Master Lonn's description: _"I can brake way later downhill just before the 50 sign and then trail brake all the way through the corner, getting into 3rd on the apex and into 2nd just before the bend to the hill to the second apex. I remembered also how to take T1 and T2."_

**S2 Transformation:** Average 31.81s → **31.15s** (0.659s faster), σ 0.75s → **0.32s** (2.3x tighter, CRUSHED the 0.5s goal). From searching for the line to LOCKED IN. When one corner becomes automatic, the whole lap flows—every other sector improved too.

**Telemetry Insights:** Compared current lap (1:29.691) to July 2025 same-series PB (1:28.969). Gap of **0.722s** is concentrated in TWO specific zones:

- **40% lap distance:** -7 km/h loss (~0.4-0.5s available, likely late S2 or mid-lap section)
- **Final corner exit:** -2.5 km/h on main straight (~0.2s loss affecting straight)

**Validated strengths:**

- T2 breakthrough confirmed: **+2.49 km/h faster** than PB lap at 10% distance
- Better power application: **+5.39 km/h** at 50% lap (full throttle vs 72%)
- Improved minimum speed: **+4.96 km/h** overall (better cornering fundamentals)

**The Pattern Recognition:** Same progression as Jefferson. Identified weak sector → found specific brake marker → locked consistency → performance unlocked. Jefferson taught the method. Rudskogen proved it transfers.

**Mental State:** "Rusty but we'll get there" (Day 1) → "Now build from here" (Day 3). No frustration, just focused problem-solving. Familiar track advantage: 4x better starting consistency than new track (Jefferson Day 1: σ = 5.71s vs Rudskogen Day 1: σ = 1.43s).

**Current Status:** Driving at **99.7% of theoretical optimal** (89.691s vs 89.463s). Only **0.722s** from same-series PB. Gap is LOCALIZED, not systemic. Two corners to fix, then the PB falls.
