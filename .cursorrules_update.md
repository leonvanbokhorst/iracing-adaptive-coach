# Update to .cursorrules - Use Formatted Output

Add this to your analysis workflow:

```python
from tools.core.analysis_formatter import print_session_analysis, print_coaching_summary

# After loading and analyzing data:
print_session_analysis(analysis, sectors)
print_coaching_summary(analysis, sectors)
```

This will format lap times as `1:30.290` instead of `90.290` seconds.
