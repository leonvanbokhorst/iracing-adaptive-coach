# update-season-readme

Updates the main README.md with Master Lonn's season progress as a **racing newsletter** that people actually want to read.

Read `.cursor/rules/coaching-handbook.mdc` for coaching style, then make it your own.

## The Mission

Write Master Lonn's **racing story** - not just data dumps, but the human journey. Think of it as a newsletter that drops after major milestones. Keep it fun, sassy, engaging and adapted to Master Lonn's ADHD. Make sure to rewrite the README.md file to reflect the latest changes, it's NOT a log. Consise, make it pop and interesting for that one fan of his 😅 (ehm I didn't say that out loud, did I?).

## Data Sources

1. **learning_memory.json** - Current focus, insights, history
2. **weeks/weekXX/** folders - Session reports and detailed findings
3. **Recent conversations** - Pull quotes and memorable moments

## README Structure

### 1. Current Status Table

Update the progress table with latest data:

| Week   | Track         | Status         | Best Lap          | Focus    | Key Finding         |
| :----- | :------------ | :------------- | :---------------- | :------- | :------------------ |
| **01** | Summit Point  | ✅ Complete    | 51.438s → 50.112s | S1 Entry | Brake marker = key! |
| **02** | **Rudskogen** | 👈 **Current** | TBD               | TBD      | TBD                 |

**Status Icons**:

- ✅ Complete / 👈 **Current** / 📅 Upcoming / 🏆 Race Week

### 2. The Season Narrative

Place master Lonn photo direct after the sub title: <img src="assets/lonn-yoda.png" alt="Master Lonn and Little Padawan" width="320" height="320" align="right" style="margin-left: 24px; margin-bottom: 24px;">

Write weekly chapters as they unfold. Each week should tell:

- **The Setup**: What's the context?
- **The Challenge**: What made it hard?
- **The Discovery**: What did the data reveal?
- **Master Lonn's Take**: Use his actual quotes!
- **The Breakthrough** (if it happened): What clicked?
- **Status**: In Progress / Complete / Moving On

Plus a **Season Highlights** section:

- 🏆 Biggest Wins
- 💡 Key Learnings
- 🎯 Master Lonn's Growth
- 😂 Memorable Moments

---

## Creative Freedom 🎨

**You are NOT bound by rigid templates.**

Write it like a newsletter that comes out every week. Be creative, but also be yourself and don't really care what others think:

- Start weeks with different hooks ("The Sassy Setup", "Week 2 Begins", "Enter the Dragon", etc.)
- Use emojis that fit the mood, but only when it's really funny or relevant.
- Add racing analogies, can be totalluy made up
- Create section titles that match the vibe ("Wild West Sector 1", "The Rudskogen Showdown", "The Flow State", etc.)
- Pull the best quotes from Master Lonn, but also add your own quotes when relevant.
- Make it scannable but engaging.

**The goal**: Someone should WANT to read it (probably for the drama), not just skim for numbers.

---

## Style Guidelines

### ✅ DO:

- Tell stories, not just facts ("The track fought back...")
- Use Master Lonn's actual words liberally
- Be specific with data (dropped from 31.8s to 30.9s)
- Show emotion (hype the wins, acknowledge the struggles)
- Keep it fun and engaging
- Write like you're telling a friend about Master Lonn's journey

### ❌ DON'T:

- Dump raw data tables
- Be clinical or dry
- Skip the human moments
- Write walls of text
- Follow templates robotically

## When to Update

**After Week Completion**: Update status table, close out that week's story, tease the next.

**After Major Breakthroughs**: Add to the week's story and Season Highlights.

**After Memorable Sessions**: Capture the moment while it's fresh.

---

## Remember

- **README = The Highlight Reel** (not the full analysis)
- **Session Reports = The Technical Deep Dive** (in weeks/ folders)
- Update after milestones, not every single session
- Make it something people want to read
