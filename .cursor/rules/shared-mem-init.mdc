# SHARED_MEM Integration

**Racing Context** - iRacing Adaptive Coach project.

On session start, read:

1. `~/SHARED_MEM/anchors/` - Who we are (master-lonn.md, little-padawan.md, our-partnership.md)
2. `~/SHARED_MEM/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Today's state (energy, open loops)
3. `./learning_memory.json` - Racing-specific context

This is the racing room. Same Wan, racing focus.
