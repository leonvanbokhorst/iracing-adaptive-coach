## Current Focus and Goal

- **Focus**: Week 04: S3 Consistency (The Uphill / T5). Trust the compression.
- **Goal**: Week 04: Sub-56s Consistent Pace. S3 σ < 0.4s.

## The Narrative

"Master Lonn came in annoyed and left even more annoyed — because the pace is **right there**, but the repeatability keeps vanishing. The data is brutally simple: most of Lime Rock is behaving, but T5 (The Uphill) is a coin flip. When you hit it, you’re basically on “sub-56” pace. When you don’t, you hemorrhage a second and the lap is dead on arrival. This wasn’t a speed problem — it was a **same-mistake, different-lap** problem."

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:
"Super frustrated. Keep making the same silly f\*ckups 🤬 Can't find consistency, let alone speed..."

**Little Wan's Take**:
"Yeah, I get it. And here’s the annoying part: the stopwatch says you’re **0.11s** from your own perfect lap. So you’re not ‘slow’ — you’re just not **repeatable** where it matters. (And yes, I’m about to say ‘T5’ like 14 times.)"

## 📊 The Numbers Game

- **Best Lap**: 00:56.591
- **Consistency (σ)**: 1.19s
- **Theoretical Optimal**: 00:56.484
- **Gap to Optimal**: 0.11s

**The Good Stuff** (✅):

- **S1 (Big Bend / T1–T2)**: σ = 0.122s — stable rhythm.
- **S2 (The Esses / T3–T4)**: σ = 0.171s — predictable.
- **S4 (West Bend → Diving Turn / T6–T7)**: σ = 0.155s — controlled.

**The "Room for Improvement"** (🚧):

- **S3 (The Uphill / T5)**: σ = 1.075s — the consistency killer.
- **Incidents (8)**: not catastrophic, but they’re clustered around “trying to be a hero” moments.

### Driving Inputs Snapshot (Fastest Lap Telemetry)

- **Top speed**: 201.0 km/h
- **Max brake pressure**: 68.6%
- **Avg brake pressure (in brake zones)**: 40.5%
- **Max decel**: -1.51 g
- **Avg throttle**: 90.6%
- **Max lateral g**: 2.43 g

## 🕵️‍♂️ Little Wan's Deep Dive

"Your lap time σ (1.19s) isn’t coming from ‘small mess everywhere’. It’s coming from **one section** going full chaos goblin.

Here’s the punchline: your best S3 is **10.349s**. That’s not ‘learning speed’. That’s ‘already capable’ speed. But your worst S3 is **14.965s** — which means the Uphill sometimes costs you **4.616s** in that sector alone. That’s not pace. That’s an incident / lift / wrong line / panic-brake moment. And it matches your vibe perfectly."

### Sector Reality (Clean Laps Only)

| Sector | Corner(s)                       | Best (s) | Avg (s) | σ (s) | Status |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| S1     | T1–T2 (Big Bend)                | 13.037   | 13.211  | 0.122 | ✅     |
| S2     | T3–T4 (The Esses)               | 14.994   | 15.228  | 0.171 | ✅     |
| S3     | T5 (The Uphill)                 | 10.349   | 10.846  | 1.075 | 🔥     |
| S4     | T6–T7 (West Bend → Diving Turn) | 18.104   | 18.382  | 0.155 | ✅     |

### The "Aha!" Moment

**You don’t need “more speed” everywhere. You need “one repeatable T5”.**

**The Data Proof**:

- **Fact**: S3 σ = 1.075s (while other sectors are ~0.12–0.17s).
- **Meaning**: Until T5 is repeatable, you’ll never feel “consistent”, even if the rest of the lap is solid.

---

## 🎯 The Mission (Focus Area)

**We are attacking**: **S3 Consistency — T5 (The Uphill)**

**Why?**:
"Because it’s responsible for the bulk of your randomness. Fix T5 and the rest of the lap starts stacking cleanly — and your brain stops spiraling."

**Next Session Goal**:

- [ ] **S3 σ < 0.40s** (currently 1.075s)
- [ ] **S3 avg < 10.600s** (currently 10.846s)
- [ ] **Best lap < 00:56.400** (stretch target; you’re already 0.11s from your own optimal)

**Process Goal (the anti-f\*ckup contract)**:

- [ ] At **T5**: **lift + light brush** only (no panic-brake), then **commit throttle before the crest**.

## 📈 The Journey

| Session          | Best Lap  | Consistency | S3 Avg  | S3 σ   | Notes                        |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :---------- | :------ | :----- | :--------------------------- |
| 2026-01-01 10:12 | 00:56.591 | 1.19s       | 10.846s | 1.075s | T5 is the coin flip (again). |

## 📝 Coach's Notebook

### What Worked ✅

- When you _do_ commit through **T5**, the lap is instantly competitive.
- S1/S2/S4 are stable enough to build a “repeatable lap” around.

### Guidebook Connections 📚

- Applied: **Track Guide (Lime Rock)** → “use the compression, don’t waste it with panic-braking” (T5).
- Candidate update: none (this session is execution, not new theory).

### Fun Stuff 😄

- T5 is officially on my “talking to” list. It’s getting mouthy.
