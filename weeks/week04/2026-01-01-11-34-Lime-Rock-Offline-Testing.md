## The Narrative

"Practice Run 2 was a big step in the right direction: fewer spins, more clean laps, and a new best lap for the day. T5 (The Uphill) is still the culprit, but it’s no longer a roulette wheel of death — it’s ‘just’ the last big leak. This session looks like you started converting chaos into reps."

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:
"Ok I did practice run 2 of today. T5 is still the culprit, but I didn't spin as much as this morning. Needs more track time."

**Little Wan's Take**:
"Finally. Less spinning is not ‘just track time’ — it means your **sequencing** is improving. You’re still beefing T5 sometimes, but you’re doing it in a way that doesn’t end in a pirouette every other lap. Progress, whether you like it or not."

## 📊 The Numbers Game

- **Best Lap**: 00:56.480 ⭐
- **Consistency (σ)**: 0.689s (**big improvement** vs the morning)
- **Theoretical Optimal**: 00:56.265
- **Gap to Optimal**: 0.215s

**The Good Stuff** (✅):

- **S3 (T5 Uphill) σ dropped** to 0.416s (was ~1.07s in the morning). That’s the “spun less” showing up in data.
- **Incidents down**: 5 (and 3 outliers filtered) with **26 clean laps** = way more usable reps.
- **S4 (T6–T7)**: σ = 0.122s — the downhill section is stable.

**The "Room for Improvement"** (🚧):

- **S3 (T5)** is still the weakest link: avg 10.670s vs best 10.299s (you’re leaving ~0.371s there on average).
- **S1/S2** have some variance (σ ~0.20s) — likely knock-on from how you exit Big Bend and set up the Esses.

### Driving Inputs Snapshot (Fastest Lap Telemetry)

- **Top speed**: 202.1 km/h
- **Max brake pressure**: 85.5%
- **Avg brake pressure (in brake zones)**: 37.0%
- **Max decel**: -1.55 g
- **Avg throttle**: 91.3%
- **Max lateral g**: 2.34 g

## 🕵️‍♂️ Little Wan's Deep Dive

"Here’s the headline: you turned your ‘T5 = spin city’ into ‘T5 = sometimes messy but survivable’. That’s huge because it unlocks repetition.

Now we go from **survival** to **precision**:

- You already diagnosed the failure mode: **you get back on throttle while the car is unsettled over the first kerb / near the red blocks**.
- The fix is boring: throttle ramp + hands calm. (If hands aren’t calm yet, the throttle is not allowed to be brave. Simple.)"

### Sector Reality (Clean Laps Only)

| Sector | Corner(s)                       | Best (s) | Avg (s) | σ (s) | Status |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| S1     | T1–T2 (Big Bend)                | 12.925   | 13.201  | 0.208 | ✅     |
| S2     | T3–T4 (The Esses)               | 14.948   | 15.231  | 0.201 | ✅     |
| S3     | T5 (The Uphill)                 | 10.299   | 10.670  | 0.416 | 🎯     |
| S4     | T6–T7 (West Bend → Diving Turn) | 18.093   | 18.311  | 0.122 | ✅     |

### The "Aha!" Moment

**You proved the fix: S3 σ went from “chaos” to “almost on-target”. Now we finish it.**

**The Data Proof**:

- **Fact**: S3 σ = 0.416s (goal is < 0.40s) — we’re basically at the target.
- **Meaning**: Stop chasing gear tricks. Chase clean sequencing: “hands quiet → foot loud”.

## 🎯 The Mission (Focus Area)

**We are attacking**: **S3 Consistency — T5 (The Uphill)**

**Why?**:
"Because now it’s the last big chunk of randomness. Fix the last 0.4s wobble and your lap times stop feeling like emotional damage."

**Next Session Goal**:

- [ ] **S3 σ < 0.40s** (currently 0.416s)
- [ ] **S3 avg < 10.550s** (currently 10.670s)
- [ ] **Consistency (σ) < 0.60s** (currently 0.689s)

**Process Goal (the anti-f\*ckup contract)**:

- [ ] At **T5**: **no red blocks**, **no brake on kerb**, and throttle is a **ramp** (20 → 40 → 70 → 100) as steering unwinds.

## 📈 The Journey

| Session          | Best Lap  | Consistency | S3 Avg  | S3 σ   | Notes                              |
| :--------------- | :-------- | :---------- | :------ | :----- | :--------------------------------- |
| 2026-01-01 10:12 | 00:56.591 | 1.19s       | 10.846s | 1.075s | T5 coin flip (spins + red blocks). |
| 2026-01-01 11:34 | 00:56.480 | 0.689s      | 10.670s | 0.416s | Much less chaos; nearly on-target. |

## 📝 Coach's Notebook

### What Worked ✅

- You reduced the “T5 death spirals” into recoverable mistakes. That’s the prerequisite for consistency.
- You’re getting closer to “boring fast” (the goal).

### Guidebook Connections 📚

- Applied: `track-lime-rock-park-grand-prix.md` → **T5 compression + minimal brake + early (but smooth) throttle**.
- Candidate update: none (this is execution + repetition).

### Fun Stuff 😄

- You’re not allowed to worship Gong’s 1st gear until you can do T5 ten times without using the red blocks as a comfort blanket.
