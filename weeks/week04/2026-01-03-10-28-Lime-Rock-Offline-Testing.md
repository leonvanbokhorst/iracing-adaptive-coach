## Current Focus and Goal

- **Focus**: **T5 (The Uphill) entry setup** — using the full track width on the LEFT side before turn-in
- **Goal**: Build spatial awareness of track edges through deliberate practice (Chapter 16: Edge Mapping Drill)
- **Secondary Goal**: S3 σ < 0.40s (currently at goal after Run 2)

## The Narrative

"Practice makes permanent. Theory makes... a guidebook chapter."

This wasn't a "go fast" session. This was a **"go learn where the paint is"** session. Master Lonn took the freshly-written Chapter 16 (Spatial Awareness & Track Limits) and actually applied it on-track within hours of it being written. That's not just fast learning—that's **active experimentation**.

The mission was simple: go slow, find the edges (especially T5 entry on the LEFT side), then ramp up speed once the spatial map was confident. The screenshots tell the story: he's now setting up T5 from the full left side of the track, not leaving the usual 30 cm "fear tax" buffer.

The lap times? Secondary. The consistency metric? Misleading (because slow drill laps mixed with fast laps inflates σ). The real win? **Building a confident mental map of where the track edges actually are.** That's the kind of work that pays dividends for months, not just one session.

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:
"Better positioning screenshots."

**Little Wan's Take**:
Okay, those four words are doing a LOT of heavy lifting, but I'll take it. 😏 You literally applied a guidebook chapter THE SAME MORNING it was written. That's not "practice"—that's **field testing.** And the screenshots? Yeah, you're kissing that left edge on T5 entry now. That's the calibration we're after. Now let's see if the exit calms down once the entry is sorted.

## 📊 The Numbers Game

**Best Lap**: 00:56.497  
**Theoretical Optimal**: 00:56.318 (gap: 0.179s)  
**Consistency (σ)**: 1.831s (expected for drill session format)

**The Good Stuff** (✅):

- **S2 (Esses) consistency**: σ = 0.194s ← Robot mode activated
- **S4 consistency**: σ = 0.190s ← Also locked in
- **Clean laps**: 25/30 (83% clean rate on a drill session is solid)
- **Best lap only 0.22s off PB** (56.497s vs 56.278s) while focusing on process, not time

**The "Room for Improvement"** (🚧):

- **S1 variance**: σ = 1.430s (high, but expected due to slow drill laps in the first block)
- **S3 (T5) variance**: σ = 1.029s (still variable, but need to separate drill laps from fast laps to assess real progress)
- **Overall σ**: 1.831s (misleading metric for a drill session—not a problem)

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Little Wan's Deep Dive

Alright, let's be real: **overall σ of 1.831s looks bad on paper**, but it's a **meaningless number** for this session type. You weren't trying to "be consistent"—you were trying to **build a spatial map**. Slow laps (70% pace) mixed with ramp-up laps (80–90%) mixed with race-pace laps = high σ by design.

What actually matters:

### The Sector Story

- **S1** (σ = 1.430s): High variance because you were deliberately going slow through T1 to find the exit edge. This is **working as intended**.
- **S2** (σ = 0.194s): The Esses are absolutely **dialed**. No drama here. Rock solid.
- **S3** (σ = 1.029s): T5 is still variable, but we need context—were the slow laps (edge-finding) in T5 the cause, or is it still snapping on the fast laps? The screenshots suggest you're now setting up WIDE on entry, which should help the exit... but the data is mixed because of the drill format.
- **S4** (σ = 0.190s): T7 exit is also locked in. Beautiful.

### The "Aha!" Moment

**You're only 0.179s from your theoretical optimal.** That means on your **best sectors combined**, you have a **56.318s lap** in you. Your actual best lap was **56.497s**. You're not "slow"—you're just leaving a couple of tenths on the table across 2–3 corners.

**The Data Proof**:

- **Fact**: Theoretical optimal = 56.318s, Best lap = 56.497s
- **Meaning**: You have all the **ingredients** for a sub-56.3s lap. You just need to put them together on the same lap.

## 🎯 The Mission (Focus Area)

**We are attacking**: **T5 (The Uphill) entry setup** — now verified with real on-track practice

**Why?**:
Because you just spent 30 laps building a mental map of where the LEFT edge of the track is before T5 turn-in. The screenshots prove you're now using the full width. Next step: **validate that the exit is calmer** when the entry is sorted. If the exit still snaps, we know it's throttle sequencing (not entry width).

**Next Session Goal**:

- [ ] **S3 σ < 0.60s** on a "normal" session (not a drill session)
- [ ] **Sub-56.3s lap time** (your theoretical optimal is already there)
- [ ] **Validate the T5 fix**: Does starting wide on entry make the exit more survivable?

## 📝 Coach's Notebook

### What Worked ✅

- **Chapter 16 (Spatial Awareness & Track Limits) → Real Practice**: Master Lonn read the chapter, understood the drill, and executed it the same day. That's **theory-to-practice speed** most drivers don't have.
- **Screenshots as validation**: The visual proof (T5 entry using full left side) is worth a thousand telemetry charts.
- **Discipline**: He stuck to the drill format (slow edge-finding → ramp up → fast laps) instead of just "going fast and hoping."

### Guidebook Connections 📚

- **Applied**: [Chapter 16: Spatial Awareness & Track Limits](../../guidebook/chapters/16-spatial-awareness-track-limits.md)  
  → First real-world test of the "Edge Mapping Drill" (3-phase: baseline → slow edge-finding → ramp-up → compare)
- **Result**: T5 entry positioning visibly improved (screenshots confirm). Exit consistency TBD (need a "normal" session to validate).

### The Telemetry Notes

- **Top Speed**: 201.0 km/h (slightly lower than previous 202.7 km/h, but expected for a drill session with slower laps)
- **Max Lat G**: 2.47 G (strong cornering load—car is being pushed)
- **Max Brake**: 74.3% (not using full brake authority—there's more available if needed)

### Fun Stuff 😄

"Better positioning screenshots." — Master Lonn's entire session debrief in four words. Efficiency level: **100%**. ADHD-approved. ✅

## 🧭 What's Next

**Immediate**:
- Do a **"normal" session** (not a drill) to validate: does the wider T5 entry setup actually calm down the exit snap?
- Target: **S3 σ < 0.60s** on a race-pace session
- Bonus: Chase the **sub-56.3s theoretical optimal** (it's already there in your sector bests)

**Strategic**:
- If T5 exit is STILL snapping after the entry fix → it's 100% throttle sequencing ("hands quiet → foot loud")
- If T5 exit is calmer → we just proved Chapter 16 works, and we move to T1/T7 edge usage next
