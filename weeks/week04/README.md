## The Story

**"The Last Laps of 2025. The First Problem of 2026."**

Week 04 started with a classic Lime Rock greeting: short straights, no time to breathe, and the walls waiting to take notes. The limit-finding session delivered a clean PB (**00:56.278**) and a rude little truth: you're already in the **top 5.3%** of the field when you keep it together.

Then 2026 showed up and immediately chose violence. Not from the whole track — from one corner: **T5 (The Uphill)**. The pattern was consistent even when you weren’t: T5 would hand you a near-perfect lap one run, then yank the rear around the next when the throttle came in too hard over the first kerb (or you flirted with the red anti-cut blocks).

The good news: Practice Run 2 proved the fix is real. **Overall σ dropped to 0.689s**, and **S3 σ (T5)** fell to **0.416s** — basically on the target. The mission is now boring and simple: keep turning T5 into a repeatable “hands quiet → foot loud” corner, and the sub-56 week PB stops being a one-off.

| Dec 30     | 2025-12-30       | Baseline      | 56.419s        | -      | First look at alien delta: exits (T5/T7) are the tax.   |

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **The Leaderboard Reality**: P65/1229 = Top 5.3%. The pace isn't "okay"—it's competitive. On a chaos day.
- **S2 Robot-Mode**: The Esses consistency (σ = 0.15s) proves elite sector work is possible.
- **The Exit Speed Story**: Identified exactly where 0.58s lives: T5 exit (crest hesitation) and T7 exit (late throttle).
- **Track Philosophy**: "Momentum is sacred. Corners chain together. 2nd gear is the floor."

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **T5 sequencing**: Throttle-on over the first kerb while still steering = snap risk. Needs repeatable throttle ramp.
- **Crest Commitment**: Fast IN to T5, hesitant OUT when the car gets light.
- **T7 Exit Speed**: Late throttle at the Diving Turn bleeds 0.35s down the main straight.
- **Overdriving**: 16.9% of lap spent sliding (more steering, less grip).

---

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- **Exit > Entry**: You can be fast INTO a corner and still lose time. The exit determines the next straight.
- **Compression Grip**: The Uphill and Diving Turn both have compression zones that GIVE you grip. Use it.
- **Less Steering = More Speed**: Overdriving (16.9%) is costing time. Smooth inputs, better grip.

**Mental:**
- **Limit-Finding Works**: 17 incidents sounds bad. But it mapped every edge and produced a PB.
- **The Bravery Is There**: Faster than alien in scary sections. The issue isn't fear—it's follow-through.

**Strategic:**
- **Two Corners to Top 10**: T5 exit + T7 exit = 0.50s. Gap to top 10 = 0.41s. The math adds up.

## The Alien Comparison

| Metric              | Master Lonn | Shuning Gong | Gap     |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----- |
| Lap Time            | 56.278s     | 55.697s      | 0.581s |
| Full Throttle %     | 70.0%       | 72.1%        | -2.1%  |
| Top Speed           | 202.7 km/h  | 210.2 km/h   | -7.6   |
| Steering Efficiency | 7.97        | 9.96         | -20%   |

**Where You're Faster**: Big Bend, Esses entry, Uphill entry ✅  
**Where You're Slower**: T5 exit, T7 exit, Main straight 🔴

## Next Steps (2026)

**Immediate**:
- [ ] S3 σ under 0.4s (currently 0.416s — basically there)
- [ ] Sub-56s lap time (0.28s away)
- [ ] Crack top 50 on leaderboard

**Technique Focus**:
1. **T7**: 100% throttle BEFORE the compression apex
2. **T5**: Full throttle BEFORE the crest
3. **Smooth Inputs**: Less steering, more grip

## 🎆 Farewell 2025

The year ends with Master Lonn in the **top 5% of the field** at a track he's known for two days. The rust from Week 01 is a distant memory. The 1238 iRating that started this journey is now **1601**. The doubts have been replaced with data. The chaos has been replaced with clarity.

2025 taught us: **Speed comes from understanding, not forcing. Consistency comes from trust, not trying harder. Victory comes from patience, not heroics.**

2026 begins with a simple mission: Fix two exits — and make T5 boring. Claim the top 10.
