## The Story

**"The Last Laps of 2025"**

The year ends not with a whimper, but with a wall—seventeen of them, actually. Master Lonn arrived at Lime Rock Park, "The Bullring," with a mission: find the limits. And find them he did. The incidents weren't failures; they were discoveries. Each spin, each off-track, each moment of chaos mapped another edge of the possible.

Buried in the carnage was a lap that told a different story. **56.278s**. A clean lap. A personal best. And when the dust settled and the leaderboard loaded: **65th out of 1,229 drivers**. Top 5.3% of the entire field. On a chaos day. During a limit-finding session.

The data revealed a beautiful paradox: Master Lonn is already FASTER than the alien in the scary sections—the Uphill entry, the Esses. The bravery is there. What's missing? Commitment on the exits. Two corners—T5 and T7—hold the key to the top 10. Fix those exits, and sub-56 isn't a dream; it's a Tuesday.

2025 ends with a PB, a plan, and proof that the pace is real. 2026 begins with a target: 0.41s to the top 10.

| **Gap to Top 10**   | -         | **0.412s**    | -           | Hugo Gómez (55.866s)       |
| **Leaderboard**     | -         | **P65/1229**  | -           | Top 5.3% of field          |

**Week Stats:**

- **Sessions**: 2 (Baseline + Limit-Finding)
- **Total Laps**: 63 (26 + 37)
- **Incidents**: 29 (12 + 17) - Aggressive exploration
- **Breakthrough**: S2 consistency (σ = 0.15s = robot-mode)
- **Discovery**: Gap to top 10 lives in exactly two corners (T5 exit, T7 exit)

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **The Leaderboard Reality**: P65/1229 = Top 5.3%. The pace isn't "okay"—it's competitive. On a chaos day.
- **S2 Robot-Mode**: The Esses consistency (σ = 0.15s) proves elite sector work is possible.
- **The Exit Speed Story**: Identified exactly where 0.58s lives: T5 exit (crest hesitation) and T7 exit (late throttle).
- **Track Philosophy**: "Momentum is sacred. Corners chain together. 2nd gear is the floor."

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **S3 Chaos Zone**: The Uphill has 1.13s σ (vs 0.15-0.25s elsewhere). Same corner, 4-7x more variance.
- **Crest Commitment**: Fast IN to T5, slow OUT. The lift over the crest is costing 0.15s.
- **T7 Exit Speed**: Late throttle at the Diving Turn bleeds 0.35s down the main straight.
- **Overdriving**: 16.9% of lap spent sliding (more steering, less grip).

---

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- **Exit > Entry**: You can be fast INTO a corner and still lose time. The exit determines the next straight.
- **Compression Grip**: The Uphill and Diving Turn both have compression zones that GIVE you grip. Use it.
- **Less Steering = More Speed**: Overdriving (16.9%) is costing time. Smooth inputs, better grip.

**Mental:**
- **Limit-Finding Works**: 17 incidents sounds bad. But it mapped every edge and produced a PB.
- **The Bravery Is There**: Faster than alien in scary sections. The issue isn't fear—it's follow-through.

**Strategic:**
- **Two Corners to Top 10**: T5 exit + T7 exit = 0.50s. Gap to top 10 = 0.41s. The math adds up.

## The Alien Comparison

| Metric              | Master Lonn | Shuning Gong | Gap    |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----- |
| Lap Time            | 56.278s     | 55.697s      | 0.581s |
| Full Throttle %     | 70.0%       | 72.1%        | -2.1%  |
| Top Speed           | 56.3 km/h   | 58.4 km/h    | -2.1   |
| Steering Efficiency | 7.97        | 9.96         | -20%   |

**Where You're Faster**: Big Bend, Esses entry, Uphill entry ✅  
**Where You're Slower**: T5 exit, T7 exit, Main straight 🔴

## Next Steps (2026)

**Immediate**:
- [ ] S3 σ under 0.4s (currently 1.13s)
- [ ] Sub-56s lap time (0.28s away)
- [ ] Crack top 50 on leaderboard

**Technique Focus**:
1. **T7**: 100% throttle BEFORE the compression apex
2. **T5**: Full throttle BEFORE the crest
3. **Smooth Inputs**: Less steering, more grip

## 🎆 Farewell 2025

The year ends with Master Lonn in the **top 5% of the field** at a track he's known for two days. The rust from Week 01 is a distant memory. The 1238 iRating that started this journey is now **1601**. The doubts have been replaced with data. The chaos has been replaced with clarity.

2025 taught us: **Speed comes from understanding, not forcing. Consistency comes from trust, not trying harder. Victory comes from patience, not heroics.**

2026 begins with a simple mission: Fix two exits. Claim the top 10.

_"The last lap of 2025 was a PB. The first lap of 2026 will be even faster."_ 🏎️💨
