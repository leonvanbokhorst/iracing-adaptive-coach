## The Story

**"The Jagged Baseline."**

We arrived at Lime Rock Park with high spirits and left with a heartbeat monitor of a consistency trace. Week 04 kicked off with a baseline session that was equal parts "speed" and "chaos." Master Lonn posted a 57.444s lap, which is a fantastic starting point, but the 12 incidents in 26 laps told a different story.

The data revealed a fascinating paradox: **"The Tale of Two Halves."** Master Lonn is currently losing massive time in the "easy" sections (Start/Finish, Big Bend) due to over-slowing, but is surprisingly FASTER than the benchmark reference in the "scary" sections (Uphill, West Bend). It seems bravery isn't the issue—discipline is. The mission for the week is clear: Fix the launch onto the main straight, and stop treating the grass like extra track surface.

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **The Bravery Confirmation**: Telemetry proves Master Lonn is faster than the reference lap through the Uphill and West Bend. The difficult, high-commitment corners are working.

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **Big Bend (Sector 1)**: Bleeding time (-1.17s/lap). Braking too early and over-slowing.
- **The "Launchpad" Uphill**: While fast, it's causing instability (1.78s sigma).
- **Incident Rate**: 12 incidents is too high. We need to stay on the track.

---

## What We Learned

**Technical:**

- **Start/Finish Speed**: The biggest loss (-14.5 km/h) comes from a poor exit out of the final corner (Downhill). Fix T7 exit = Free speed everywhere.

**Mental:**

- **Over-Respecting the Easy Stuff**: We are driving too cautiously in the simple corners (T1) while attacking the dangerous ones. Need to balance the aggression.
