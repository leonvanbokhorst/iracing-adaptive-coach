## The Story

Seven months is a long time in sim racing. When Master Lonn returned to Summit Point, he expected rust—relearning corners, recalibrating muscle memory, fighting the car to find speed.

Instead, his first lap was 1.4 seconds faster than his old PB.

The growth from Weeks 01-06 had compounded into something invisible until he was back on familiar ground. He wasn't the same driver who struggled here seven months ago. He was *better*. Smoother. More confident. The car that used to fight him now listened.

But the baseline session revealed the truth hiding in the data: two nemesis corners—Turn 1 and the Carousel—were bleeding time. 88% of all rotation events lived in those two zones. The gap to Shuning Gong (P4 on the leaderboard) was 1.1 seconds. Not talent. *Commitment*.

Day two changed everything. Seventeen minutes. Two focus areas: T5 coasting (no trail braking into the Carousel) and T1 late braking (full commitment after the three cones). No chasing lap times. No heroics. Just deliberate, focused drilling.

The data came back: **59% oversteer reduction at T5**. Automaticity forming at T1. PB matched without trying. The EXPERT coach technique—coast into T5, don't trail brake—*worked*.

That evening, exhausted, he did a flow session. Just drive, have fun, see what stuck. Twenty-five minutes of rallycross-mode shenanigans. The result? **NEW PB: 1:15.550**. The morning's technique work had bedded in during play. Speed came as byproduct.

Then came the races. AI Race 03 was an epic battle—lost the lead to Steve, went off-track, chased him down, traded paint twice, made a ballsy pass into The Paddock, defended through a misshift. Victory from chaos. *"I'm one fast son of a bitch."*

But the real test came Tuesday. Official Race 01. TOP SPLIT. SoF 2045.

He botched qualifying—two off-tracks, no time, P10 start. In a field of Division 1-2 drivers, he was starting from the back.

He deployed Meebewegen from the lights. Let the aggressive car through—*"let him wreck himself."* Pressured Sato until he spun. Collected positions through patience and consistency. Finished P5 with only 1x incident.

The data told the story: **T5 brake point σ = 1.0 METER** across 10 race laps. One meter. The "no trail braking" mantra he'd said 8 times during the race had become automatic execution. **10/10 corners DIALED** under TOP SPLIT pressure.

+38 iRating. +0.04 SR. **76 championship points**.

*"Hell yeah! That was a good race. I did pretty well."*

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **Verbal Self-Cueing → Automatic Execution**: "No trail braking" said 8 times during official race = T5 brake σ of 1.0 METER. Conscious verbal cues trigger automatic neural pathways.

- **Focused Practice > Mindless Laps**: 17-minute session with 2 focus areas produced 59% T5 improvement and PB-matching pace. Quality > quantity.

- **Flow Consolidation**: Morning drilling + evening "just have fun" = NEW PB. Technique work beds in during play.

- **10/10 Corners Dialed Under Race Pressure**: Complete track mastery maintained in TOP SPLIT official racing.

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **Qualifying Discipline**: Two off-tracks cost grid position (P10 start instead of P5-7). Cold tire management needs work.

- **Gap to Practice PB**: Race best 1:16.433 vs practice PB 1:15.550 (0.88s gap). Room to deploy more pace in traffic.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- T5 coasting technique (no trail braking) is now automatic—1.0m brake point σ proves muscle memory
- Throttle application rate faster on exit when committed to no-trail-brake entry

**Mental:**
- "Drive your race, not theirs" held throughout TOP SPLIT pressure
- Verbal cueing works as technique trigger under stress
- "Feels like second nature" = conscious → automatic transition complete

**Strategic:**
- 76 points banked with 3 more attempts available (best-1-of-4 system)
- Meebewegen in TOP SPLIT: let aggressive drivers self-destruct
- Cold Tire Contract Win Streak: 7/8

---

## Next Steps

**Remaining Week 07:**
- 3 more official race attempts to beat 76 points
- Focus on qualifying discipline (no off-tracks!)
- Target: P4 or better with clean quali = 80+ points

**Week 08 (VIR North):**
- New track
- Apply Sequential Mastery framework
- Deploy verbal cueing methodology from Week 07
