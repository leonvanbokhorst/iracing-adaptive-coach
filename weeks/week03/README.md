## The Story

This week was a masterclass in **rapid evolution**. Master Lonn returned to Winton after 18 months away, expecting rust. Instead, he found speed. By Session 1, the 18-month-old PB was gone. By Session 3, he had unlocked a fundamental physics insight ("Engine Braking vs Trail Braking") that transformed his driving.

But the real test came in the AI simulations. The "Cold Tire Contract" was forged in fire—after spinning on cold tires in practice, a strict protocol was written: **Survival first, speed second.**

The climax? A **P11 to P1 Victory** in the final AI race. Master Lonn executed the contract perfectly (slow laps 1-3), then unleashed "Alien Mode" (1:25.7s) to slice through the field with 0 incidents. He didn't just beat the AI; he out-thought them. He proved that **patience is a weapon**.

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **Engine Braking Rotation**: Discovered that lifting + downshifting to 3rd (no brake) at T5 provides smoother, more stable rotation than trail braking for the light FF1600.
- **The Cold Tire Contract v2.0**: A disciplined protocol for Laps 1-2 (Survival Mode, Brake @ 60m T11). When executed, it leads to victories.
- **X-Ray Vision**: In traffic, looking *through* the car ahead to the track prevents "Target Fixation" and reaction-based driving.
- **The Negative Split**: Giving up time early (Laps 1-3) to drive faster late (Laps 6+). Proven in the final race (P11 -> P1).

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **Qualifying Psychology**: Race pace (1:25.7) is significantly faster than Qualifying pace (1:27.1). Nerves/Red Mist still blocking flow state on the single lap.
- **Turn 11 (Cold Tires)**: The "50m board" muscle memory is strong, but dangerous on cold tires. Requires conscious override to 60m for first 2 laps.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- **Short Gear Stack** (Winton) vs Tall (Rudskogen) changes the engine braking profile completely.
- **Brake Bias Protocol**: Start 57.5% (Stability), click down to 56.5% (Rotation) after Lap 3.

**Mental:**
- **Pressure is Fuel**: Master Lonn drives better (sharper, faster) when threatened by Hard AI than when cruising with Medium AI.
- **Trust > Force**: The fastest laps came when driving "calmer" and letting the momentum do the work.

**Strategic:**
- **Position Secured Protocol**: Works.
- **Shadow Protocol**: Works for traffic desensitization.

## Next Week Preview

**Track**: Winton Motor Raceway (Official Race Week)  
**Challenge**: Real humans, real iRating on the line.  
**Goal**: **Top 5 Finishes & Clean Races**  
**Strategy**: Execute the "Cold Tire Contract" every single race. Survive L1-L2. Let the impatient crash. Attack L3+.
