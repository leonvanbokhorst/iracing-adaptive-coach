## The Story

The French rollercoaster opened its arms and asked for a dance.

Master Lonn arrived at Lédenon carrying the weight of Week 08—three official races at VIR North, iRating down 35 points, but technique sharper than ever. The Roller Coaster σ = 0.082s. Snake brake point σ = 0.2 meters. Machine-like precision that didn't show up in the standings.

Lédenon was supposed to be the reset. A new track, 8 corners, blind crests everywhere—the kind of place that punishes hesitation and rewards trust. Anti-clockwise, which meant long sequences of medium-speed lefts testing his weaker side. The track dossier warned: *"The first few sessions can feel claustrophobic and chaotic."*

Eleven laps. Zero incidents. And by Lap 12, the car and driver found their rhythm.

> *"What a beautiful rollercoaster... I like it... flowy... asks to dance... last corner is weird."*

The data agreed with every word. S2 consistency: 0.409s—the "flowy" section. La cuvette variance: 0.497s—the "weird" corner. His nervous system already knew what the numbers took 1,000 samples to confirm.

But the Gong comparison dropped a reality check: 4.752 seconds slower. And the diagnosis wasn't overdriving—it was **underdriving**. Gong pulls 2.82 G max lateral. Master Lonn: 2.56 G. At La servie alone, 0.76 G of untapped grip. The car can do it. His mind says "careful."

The fix isn't trying harder. It's trusting more.

## Session Log

| Date | Time | Type | Best Lap | σ | Result | Key Takeaway |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:---------|:--|:-------|:-------------|
| Feb 5 | 16:36 | Baseline | **1:30.350** | 1.058s | [Report](2026-02-05-16-36-ledenon-baseline-practice.md) | 5/8 dialed, La cuvette = "weird one" |

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **Feel-Data Sync**: Master said "flowy" → S2 σ = 0.409s. Said "weird last corner" → La cuvette σ = 0.497s. The instincts are calibrated.
- **La Courmelle Dialed**: σ = 0.056s, ZERO oversteer events. Proof that commitment → consistency.
- **Underdriving Diagnosis**: The problem isn't too much aggression—it's too little trust. 0.26 G of grip sitting unused.

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **La cuvette** (0.497s σ): Blind compression corner. VIR Roller Coaster v2. Time range 5.9s–7.7s.
- **Triple Gauche** (0.463s σ): Multi-apex mental load. Needs "one arc" thinking.
- **La servie** (0.69s loss vs Gong): Biggest single opportunity. Load the front tires harder.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- Underdriving is harder to detect than overdriving. The car feels controlled, but grip goes unused.
- La Courmelle (0.02s off Gong) proves the technique exists. Copy-paste to other corners.

**Mental:**
- First session caution is natural—but "careful" costs 2+ seconds per lap.
- Trust the compression. The bowl gives grip. Commit before you can see it.

**Strategic:**
- Gong doesn't brake at Virage du Camion. It's a lift corner, not a brake corner.
- ~2.1s addressable through commitment alone. Won't close 4.7s gap Day 1, but the path is clear.
