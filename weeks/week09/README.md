## Pre-Week Context

Coming off a challenging Week 08 at VIR North where iRating dipped (-35) despite solid technique development. The Roller Coaster commitment lessons and "false apex" mental model shift should translate well to Lédenon's blind crests and commitment corners.

**Entering iRating**: 1684  
**Entering SR**: 3.21

## Track Character

"Rollercoaster in a Bowl" — anti-clockwise, 13 corners, blind crests, off-camber entries, and almost no moment when the car isn't loaded up.

**Key challenges from dossier:**
- **Anti-clockwise anomaly** — Long sequences of medium-speed lefts test your weaker side
- **Elevation as a weapon** — Crests hide apexes; compressions spike grip
- **Rhythm track** — String corners into 3-4 big shapes, not isolated events
- **Commitment in the blind** — References before the crest, trust them

**VIR lessons to apply:**
- Roller Coaster commitment methodology → Lédenon's blind crests
- "False apex" mental model → Think in sequences, not individual corners
- Brake point consistency as commitment proxy

---

## Initial Focus Areas

1. **Map the rollercoaster** (Day 1) — Name terrain features out loud, build mental model
2. **Sequence thinking** (Day 2) — Drive sections as one giant corner, quiet hands
3. **Trust over crests** — Apply VIR Roller Coaster commitment lessons
