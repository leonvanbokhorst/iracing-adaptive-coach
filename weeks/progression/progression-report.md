| Metric             | Value                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |

### Week 04: Lime Rock Park Grand Prix

| Metric             | Value                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Position**       | 383 / 10,096 (week-specific) |
| **iRating**        | 1672 (+71)                   |
| **Points**         | 94.0 (week only)             |

| **Incidents/Race** | 0.00                         |

**The Story:** "I have no clue how to take T5 properly." That was January 1st. Chapter 16 Spatial Awareness written that morning. Edge Mapping at 70% pace. Three hours later: T5 was 1.87 km/h FASTER than series leader Shuning Gong. Official race: SoF 2035. A faster car caught him. The old Master Lonn might have fought. The new one opened the door. P3. Zero incidents. First Top Split podium.

### Week 05: Motorsport Arena Oschersleben GP

| Metric             | Value                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Position**       | 106 / 27,864 (Top 0.38%) |
| **iRating**        | 1738 (+66)               |

| **Incidents/Race** | 1.91                     |

**The Story:** T2 Hotel Exit—a long, decreasing-radius, downhill right-hander where GR86 muscle memory goes to die. Session 2: σ 2.257s. A lottery. Over six days, consistency-first methodology carved it to σ 0.153s in race conditions. The Achilles heel died.

Two official races, both Top Split:

- Race 01: P10→P5, NEW PB 1:32.700 on no sleep, +31 iR
- Race 02: P7→P4, 0x clean, T2 MASTERED, +35 iR

## 🔮 Projections for Rest of Season

### Current Trajectory (+66 iR/week average weeks 4-5)

| Week     | Track       | Projected iRating | Projected Position |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 06       | Oran Park   | ~1800             | ~90                |
| 08       | VIR North   | ~1930             | ~65                |
| 10       | Oulton Park | ~2060             | ~45                |
| 12 (End) | Navarra     | ~2190             | ~30                |

### Reality Check

The +139/+117/+107/+71/+66 progression shows natural deceleration as you climb into tougher competition. Expect stabilization around +40-60/week. That's still excellent—and enough to break 2000 iRating by season end.

## 🧠 Little Padawan's Five-Week Analysis

Master Lonn, here's the honest assessment after 5 weeks:

**You're not slowing down—you're stabilizing at elite level.**

The data tells a clear story:

- Week 01-03: Explosive growth (+363 iR, learning phase)
- Week 04-05: Consolidation (+137 iR, competing against Top Split fields)

The competition got harder, not you getting worse. You went from racing average splits to consistently finishing Top 5 in Top Split. That's a different sport.

**Key Patterns:**

1. **Problem-Solving Speed** — T5 solved in 3 hours (Week 04), T2 solved in 6 days (Week 05). Getting faster at diagnosing AND fixing.

2. **Race Day Performance** — Both PBs came in official races, not practice. You're a pressure performer.

3. **Clean Aggression** — 0x in final Oschersleben race while gaining 3 positions. Meebewegen is now instinct, not strategy.

4. **Mental Resilience** — PB on no sleep. Recovery after contact. Drama queen energy channeled into performance.

**Where you stand:** Championship P106 of 27,864. Top 0.38%. Two official wins, one podium, two Top Split top-5s. +500 iRating in 5 weeks.

**What's next:** Oran Park. A momentum playground. The figure-eight bridge. Suttons double-apex. Time to see if the flow state travels to Australia. 🦘
