## The Story

There's a specific kind of confidence that comes from returning to familiar corners. Master Lonn arrived at VIR North expecting a fight—it's been two years since he drove the Full Course, and only 50% of North's corners overlap. What he found instead was a homecoming.

Fifteen of twenty-one corners clicked on the first lap. Horseshoe, Snake, Roller Coaster—his hands remembered them like old friends. The timing was different, the sequence compressed, but the muscle memory was there. "It's flowy," he said mid-session, the car dancing through elevation changes. "It's a dancing circuit."

And then the Gong comparison arrived.

2.717 seconds. Not to some legendary alien—to another driver in the same series, same car. The speed delta map painted the track almost entirely red. Same top speed, but 3.5 km/h less through every corner. Same car, but 0.24g of unused grip. The data didn't lie: Master Lonn wasn't slow because he lacked skill. He was slow because he lacked *commitment*.

Two corners emerged as the battleground: T3 NASCAR Bend (braking when Gong stays flat—23 km/h slower) and T10 Roller Coaster (overbraking, mid-corner lifting—20 km/h slower). Combined: 0.87 seconds sitting on the table, waiting.

The mantra for tomorrow is simple: *"First apex = kink, stay flat."*

|--------|-------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Best Lap** | 1:31.517 | - | - | Day 1 baseline |
| **Consistency (σ)** | 5.484s | - | - | Exploration variance |
| **Gap to Gong** | 2.717s | - | - | Target: < 2.0s |
| **Corners Dialed** | 15/21 | - | - | Full Course memory! |

**Day 1 Stats:**
- **Sessions**: 1 baseline practice
- **Flying Laps**: 10

## Session Log

| Date | Time | Type | Best Lap | σ | Result | Key Takeaway |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:---------|:--|:-------|:-------------|
| Jan 30 | 15:02 | Baseline | **1:31.517** | 5.484s | [Report](2026-01-30-15-02-vir-baseline-practice-voice.md) | 15/21 dialed, Full Course transfer |

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **Full Course Memory Transfer**: 80 laps from 2 years ago = 15 corners dialed on Day 1. Muscle memory persists.
- **EXPERT Guide Deployment**: "Sacrifice that corner for the next one" applied at T4 within first 10 minutes.
- **Crash Recovery**: PB on Lap 9, crash on Lap 10, clean 1:32.250 on Lap 11. Resilience is automatic now.

## Challenges 🚧

### T3 NASCAR Bend (-0.37s to Gong)

**The Problem**: Braking 23% of corner when Gong brakes 6%. Min speed 103.7 vs 126.9 km/h.

**The Fix**: First apex = kink, stay FLAT. Only brush brake for second apex.

### T10 Roller Coaster (-0.50s to Gong)

**The Problem**: Overbraking (33% vs 15%), mid-corner lift when should be flat.

**The Fix**: Brake 2 car lengths later, commit to throttle earlier.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- VIR North rewards commitment over caution. Same top speed, different corner speed = trust gap.
- The climbing section (T8-T11) that doesn't exist on Full Course is the true nemesis.

**Mental:**
- "I love it!" after crashing = correct mindset for limit-finding.
- Knowing when to stop (12 laps, baseline done) prevents unlearning.

**Strategic:**
- Gong comparison reveals 0.87s in just two corners. Targeted practice > scattered laps.

## Track Character

VIR North is the "greatest hits" of Virginia International Raceway—Horseshoe, Snake, Roller Coaster, Hog Pen compressed into one intense loop.

**Key challenges:**
- **Elevation as drama** — 100+ ft changes, car constantly loading/unloading
- **Flow over fragments** — Sequences, not individual corners
- **No relax sectors** — Mental ahead of physical
- **Old-school edges** — 1950s consequences for mistakes

## Alien Target

**EXPERT pace:** ~1:28.5  
**Gong comparison:** 1:28.800 (Gap: 2.717s)

![Speed Delta vs Gong](comparison/2026-01-30-speed-delta-vs-gong.png)

| Metric | Master Lonn | Gong | Gap |
|--------|-------------|------|-----|
| Top Speed | 210.9 km/h | 210.2 km/h | ✅ Same |
| Avg Speed | 149.5 km/h | 153.0 km/h | **-3.5 km/h** |
| Full Throttle | 69.0% | 72.7% | **-3.7%** |
| Max Lat G | 2.33g | 2.57g | **-0.24g headroom** |

**Top Loss Zones:**

| Corner | Time Loss | Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **T10 Roller Coaster** | -0.50s | Brake later, stay flat mid-corner |
| **T3 NASCAR Bend** | -0.37s | FLAT through first apex |
| T12b | -0.15s | Trust compression |

## Next Session Focus

**Target: Break 1:30.0**

1. **T3 NASCAR Bend** — _"First apex = kink, stay flat"_
2. **T10 Roller Coaster** — Brake 2 car lengths later, commit mid-corner

Fix these two corners = 0.87s = **1:30.6** before touching anything else.

## Key Techniques (EXPERT Guide)

| Corner | Technique | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| T3 NASCAR | FLAT first apex, brush for second | Double apex, first is a kink |
| T7 Compression | STOP trail braking | Uphill = front grip, trailing = rear loss |
| T10 Roller Coaster | CONTINUE trail braking | Downhill = need front load to turn |
| T17 Hog Pen | Full throttle AT compression | Use physics, don't fight understeer |
