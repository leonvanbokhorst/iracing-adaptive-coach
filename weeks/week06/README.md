## Track Character

From the [dossier](../../tracks/track-oran-park-raceway-grand-prix.md):

> _"For the Ray FF1600, Oran Park is basically fan-service. It's a **momentum playground** where bravery is less important than staying light on your hands and honest with your exits."_

**Key Features:**
- **Figure-eight bridge** — You drive over your own approach line. Surreal.
- **No real straights** — Short chutes between corners, nowhere to hide bad exits
- **Bumps with stories** — Decades of patching, local knowledge matters
- **Compact layout** — Crowd is always close, every mistake is visible

## Week 06 Focus

Coming off Oschersleben (T2 mastered, 14/14 corners dialed), the focus is:

**"Old-school flow"** — Rhythm over heroics

Key areas:
1. **Pits Bend + Coca-Cola chain** — One braking event, then carry
2. **Bridge approach** — Arrive calm, build confidence
3. **Suttons double-apex** — Trail brake → micro-pause → slingshot exit
