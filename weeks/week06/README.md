## The Story

The track bit first.

Champion Curve—blind entry, climbing, tightening—didn't ask if Master Lonn belonged on Day 1. It told him he didn't. Multiple offs. Multiple spins. A 3-second swing at one corner that could eject you to the gravel or give you a clean exit, depending on which version of luck you brought.

But even while the Australian rollercoaster was teaching respect through pain, something was building. Lap 1: 1:17.4. Lap 14: **1:12.583**. Five seconds in 23 minutes. Six corners dialed on first contact. The offs weren't failure—they were the tuition fee for a track that demands precision through elevation changes Master Lonn had never felt before.

Two days later, he came back with a mission: conquer Champion Curve.

And he didn't just tame it. He **obliterated** it.

Champion Curve Entry went from 0.898s variance (lottery) to **0.072s** (laser precision). That's **92% improvement** in one session. Champion Curve Exit? Work-needed to **0.052s dialed** with 0.2-meter apex precision. The Week 06 goal was "σ < 0.4s." He achieved 0.072s. That's **82% better than the target**.

The result? **1:11.617**. NEW PERSONAL BEST. **0.966 seconds** faster than Practice 01.

But speed has a price when you're hunting the limit. Foster's Dip—a compound corner with compression and elevation—sent him spinning twice (Laps 8 & 9). Coca-Cola's brake point started wandering 45 meters lap-to-lap. The consistency suffered (2.064s σ), but the pace was REAL. Only **0.217s** from theoretical optimal.

This is what limit-finding looks like: you can't discover the edge without falling off it a few times.

**The Score**: 1:12.583 → **1:11.617** (NEW PB) | Champion Curve MASTERED | Gap to Gong: 2.0s (was 2.7s)

## Breakthroughs 🎯

### Champion Curve Mastery (Practice 02)

**What happened**: Single-corner focus for 2 sessions resulted in 92% improvement (0.898s → 0.072s σ). Both Entry and Exit went from lottery/work-needed to DIALED. Apex Exit precision: 0.2 meters (LASER).

**Why it mattered**: This was the Week 06 goal. Target was σ < 0.4s. Achieved 0.072s/0.052s = 82% overachievement. Validates the "conquer ONE corner fully before attacking the next" methodology. Champion Curve is now a reference standard.

**Technique discovered**: Feeling-based learning (not overthinking), progressive commitment (cautious early, aggressive later), repetition = neural rewiring. The corner is now muscle memory.

### Personal Best: 1:11.617 (Practice 02)

**What happened**: 0.966s faster than Practice 01 in ONE session. Gap to theoretical optimal: only 0.217s (AT the limit).

**Why it mattered**: This wasn't incremental improvement. This was a leap. And it came WHILE mastering Champion Curve—proof that fixing one nemesis corner frees mental bandwidth to push elsewhere. 8/12 corners DIALED, full throttle usage up 8.7%.

**The trade-off**: Consistency suffered (2.064s σ) due to two massive offs at Foster's Dip while finding the edge. This is textbook limit-finding: you can't discover the edge without falling off it.

## Challenges 🚧

### Foster's Dip Complex (NEW)

**What's blocking progress**: Compound corner with blind entry, elevation drop (compression), and climbing exit. Entry σ 0.308s (apex wandering 19.3m). Exit σ 1.556s (speed variance 30.17 km/h!). Lap 8 catastrophic off (8.15s corner vs 2.0s best). Lap 9 basically stopped (0.2 km/h).

**Strategy to overcome**: 
- **Priority 1**: Foster's Dip Entry — apex σ < 10m (positioning over bravery, slow in/fast out)
- **Priority 2**: Foster's Dip Exit — speed variance < 10 km/h (trust compression, commit to exit)
- This is the new nemesis. S3 variance is 1.899s entirely due to Foster's Dip disasters.

### Coca-Cola Brake Point Drift (NEW)

**What's blocking progress**: Was solid (0.221s σ) in Practice 01 → lottery (0.489s σ) in Practice 02. Brake point wandering **45.6 meters** lap-to-lap (~2 car lengths!). Cause: pushing harder post-Champion Curve mastery, no consistent visual marker. 2083 oversteer events (highest of any corner).

**Strategy to overcome**: Pick ONE brake marker, hit it every lap. Brake σ target: < 10m (currently 45.6m). Entry speed might need sacrifice for exit stability. Consistent 6.8s corner > 6.6s/8.6s lottery.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**

- **Single-corner focus = massive gains**: Champion Curve 92% improvement in 2 sessions validates the "conquer one corner fully before the next" approach. Don't fix everything at once—systematic, sequential improvement is faster.
- **Limit-finding has a price**: Practice 01 (safe, consistent 1.539s σ) vs Practice 02 (aggressive, chaotic 2.064s σ but 0.966s faster). You can't discover the edge without falling off it. The offs are tuition, the PB is profit.
- **0.217s from optimal = AT the limit**: The big gains are no longer in "going faster"—they're in **eliminating disasters** (Foster's Dip) and **stabilizing inconsistencies** (Coca-Cola brake drift).

**Mental:**

- **Conquering one nemesis reveals new ones**: Fixing Champion Curve freed mental bandwidth to push elsewhere. Result: new speed found (1:11.617), new problems discovered (Foster's Dip, Coca-Cola). This is the natural progression of improvement.
- **Feeling-based learning works**: Master Lonn didn't overthink Champion Curve—he FELT where the grip was. Progressive commitment + repetition = mastery. The 0.2m apex precision came from hands, not analysis.
- **PBs can come through chaos**: The 1:11.617 came in a session with 2 massive offs. The pace is REAL despite the drama. Speed doesn't require perfect conditions—it requires the right mental state (flow, not forcing).

**Strategic:**

- **Foster's Dip = compound corner challenge**: Blind entry + compression + elevation chains errors (bad Entry → bad Exit). Requires positioning over bravery. Trust the compression = front tire load = less braking needed mid-corner.
- **Coca-Cola needs a brake marker**: 45.6m drift = guessing every lap. Visual consistency is the foundation of everything else. Fix the marker, the rest follows.
- **Week 06 goal achieved, shift focus**: Champion Curve is DONE (82% better than target). Next priority: Foster's Dip (biggest addressable loss) + Coca-Cola (brake consistency).

## Next Week Preview

**Track**: Oran Park Raceway - GP (continued)  
**Challenge**: Make the 1:11.617 REPEATABLE without the disasters  
**Goal**: 
- Foster's Dip Entry: apex σ < 10m
- Foster's Dip Exit: speed variance < 10 km/h  
- Coca-Cola: brake σ < 10m
- Sub-1:12 average with zero catastrophic offs

**Strategy**: 
- Champion Curve is DONE—don't touch it, just repeat Lap 16 technique
- Foster's Dip takes priority (biggest addressable loss ~0.5-1.0s)
- Coca-Cola secondary (pick marker, repeat 10x)
- Goal: consistency, not more speed. The pace exists (1:11.617). Now make it boring.
