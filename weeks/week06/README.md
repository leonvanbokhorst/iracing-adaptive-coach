## The Story

There's a specific kind of arrogance tracks like Oran Park have. "Ups and downs," Master Lonn called them on Day 1. But they weren't just elevation changes—they were character tests. Champion Curve started the week as a bully, tossing the car into 3-second variances and spins. It ended the week as a conquest: mastered, dialed, laser-precise.

The week was a study in paradoxes. Master Lonn found **1.55 seconds of pace** in three days, setting four consecutive personal bests. He discovered a technique for Foster's Dip that defied conventional logic ("light brakes before the curbs") and proved it with data. He turned Yokohama Bridge—a blind, terrifying high-speed kink—from a practice nemesis into a race weapon.

But racing isn't just about speed. It's about the "Stupid Hero Paradox." Race 02 saw him start P1 with elite consistency and alien pace, only to lose the win to a "hero move" on Lap 9. The lesson wasn't about finding more tenths—it was about trusting the tenths he already had. The speed is there. The consistency is pro-level. Now, the mission is simply to be "boring" enough to win.

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **Champion Curve Mastery**: Went from 3-second lottery (σ 0.898s) to laser precision (σ 0.072s). The Week 06 goal was obliterated.
- **Yokohama Transformation**: Practice nemesis (0.251s σ) → Race weapon (0.039s σ). Master Lonn learned to COMMIT under pressure.
- **Foster's Dip Technique**: "Light brakes, don't touch left curbs." Self-discovered, data-validated, now muscle memory.
- **Elite Consistency**: Race 02 σ of **0.619s** proves professional-grade repeatability is possible.

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **"The Stupid Hero"**: P1 starts converted to P4/P2 finishes because of "trying" instead of "flowing."
- **Coca-Cola Corner**: Brake point wandering (37.4m σ in Race 01). Confidence issue under pressure.
- **Traffic Management**: Struggled to find overtaking spots (Laps 9-10 Race 01). Oran Park is tight; needs a plan.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**
- **BB 56%** is the magic number. More stable turn-in, sharp front bite.
- **Commitment > Effort**: Yokohama (committed) is faster/safer than Coca-Cola (trying).

**Mental:**
- **"Boring Wins"**: Consistency (Race 02) would have won the race if not for one "hero move."
- **Resilience**: Lap 8 recovery in Race 01 (5s gain back immediately) proves the reset switch works.

**Strategic:**
- **P1 Protection**: When leading, the goal is to NOT LOSE, not to gap the field.

## Next Week Preview

**Track**: Summit Point - Main Course (Week 07)  
**Challenge**: High speed, heavy braking T1, technical chute.  
**Goal**: Carry the "Boring Win" mindset. No heroics.  
**Strategy**: Apply the Sequential Mastery method (one corner at a time).
