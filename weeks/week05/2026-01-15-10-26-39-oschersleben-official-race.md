## Current Focus and Goal

- **Focus**: Precision on the Plain
- **Goal**: Break **1:32.5**

---

## The Narrative

_Clean, controlled, and patient. You let the chaos eat itself, kept your distance, and cashed in with a calm P4. That is professional racecraft, not heroics._

---

## 🏎️ The Vibe Check

**Master Lonn's Take**:

> "Very clean and controlled. Kept distance from erratic drivers, watched them crash and burn. P4 is a good result. T3: had to let a faster driver go and went wide once."

**Little Wan's Take**:

Yep. That is the **Meebewegen** playbook executed with zero drama. P4 in top split with 0x is a W, even if the points are stingy.

## 📊 The Numbers Game

**Best Lap**: **1:33.367**  
**Consistency (σ)**: **0.773s**

### Lap Evolution

![Lap Evolution](assets/2026-01-15-10-26-39-lap-evolution.png)

| Lap |     Time     | Notes                 |
| :-: | :----------: | :-------------------- |
|  1  |   1:40.433   | Outlap                |
|  5  |   1:33.383   | First real attack lap |
|  7  | **1:33.367** | Best lap              |
|  8  |   1:33.933   | Cooldown / closing    |

**The Good Stuff** (✅):

- 0x race in top split = **clean execution**
- S2 consistency: **σ 0.126s** (calm and repeatable)
- T2 Hotel Exit stayed **solid** (σ 0.153s)

**The "Room for Improvement"** (🚧):

- S1 loss per lap is the largest (0.429s) → time is hiding there
- T3 Hasseroeder variance: **σ 0.259s** — race context (yielded + wide), not technique

## 🔬 IBT Deep Dive

### Car Control (Oversteer Analysis)

- **Max Yaw Rate**: 52.4°/s
- **Avg Yaw Rate**: 12.2°/s

**Oversteer Hotspots (by corner):**

| Corner             | Events | Notes                        |
| :----------------- | :----: | :--------------------------- |
| T3 Hasseroeder     |  1267  | Heavy rotation under load    |
| T2 Hotel Exit      |  1130  | Still active but controlled  |
| T7 Hairpin         |  1034  | Entry rotation spikes        |
| T14 Zeppelin Kurve |  780   | Exit rotation under throttle |

### Tire Temps (Driving Style Fingerprint)

| Tire | Inside | Middle | Outside | Balance     |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| LF   | 65.8   | 70.3   | 72.2    | outside hot |
| RF   | 70.2   | 68.3   | 62.3    | inside hot  |
| LR   | 65.9   | 69.8   | 70.8    | balanced    |
| RR   | 69.6   | 68.5   | 63.3    | inside hot  |

**Interpretation**: Mild inside-hot on RF/RR suggests you're loading the inside edge under rotation. Not a problem, but it punishes abrupt steering.

### Sector Breakdown

| Sector |  Best  |  Avg   |   σ   | Status |
| :----- | :----: | :----: | :---: | :----- |
| S1     | 34.083 | 34.512 | 0.462 | 🚧     |

## 🔬 Technique Analysis (Race Context)

_Note: In race sessions, brake point and apex variance often reflects traffic management and racecraft decisions, not technique issues. This data is more useful in practice sessions._

### Input Smoothness (Race-Relevant)

| Input        | Metric              |        Value |
| :----------- | :------------------ | -----------: |
| **Steering** | Avg Jerk            | 10.39 rad/s² |
| **Throttle** | Avg Jerk            |   618.4 %/s² |
|              | Full Throttle Usage | 47.8% of lap |
| **Brake**    | Max Pressure Used   |         100% |
|              | Avg When Braking    |        68.8% |

### 🎯 Little Wan's Technique Interpretation

#### T3 Hasseroeder: Race Context Variance

**The Fact**: Apex σ **14.3 m** and time σ **0.259s**.  
**Race Context**: One lap yielded to faster driver, one lap went wide. This is racecraft, not technique failure.  
**The Takeaway**: In clean air, T3 consistency would likely match other corners.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Little Wan's Deep Dive

You raced smart. The data backs your feeling: S2 is calm, T2 is under control, and the car stayed together. T3 variance was race context (yielding + one wide), not a technique problem.

---

## 🎯 The Mission (Focus Area)

**We are attacking**: Nothing specific. Track is dialed, racecraft is solid.

**Why?**  
T3 variance was race context, not a skill gap. In clean air you'd have 14/14 corners dialed.

**Next Session Goals**:

- [ ] Maintain clean racecraft
- [ ] Build on PB in practice if energy allows
