## The Challenge

**"Precision on the Plain"**

Oschersleben is Germany's discipline exam. No elevation changes to guide you. No dramatic compressions. Just flat, technical, and brutally honest about your consistency.

The track looks simple. It's not.

**Key Features:**
- **T1 (Hotel)**: The chaos magnet. Heavy braking, cold tires, pack fighting for the same apex. Good Oschersleben drivers make T1 boring on purpose.
- **McDonald's Chicane**: The signature feature. Short, sharp, edged with curbs that end race weekends. Fast laps feel "boringly tidy" here.
- **Reference-Point Circuit**: No trees on crests, no dramatic skyline. Your landmarks are brake boards, marshal posts, painted curbs. This track rewards "I hit my mark" over "I sent it."

## Week 05 Strategy

### Apply the Proven Playbook

| Day | Focus | Goal |
|:----|:------|:-----|
| **Day 1** | Track walk + Baseline | Learn the layout, identify problem corners |
| **Day 2** | Edge Mapping Drill (Chapter 16) | Build spatial map at 70% pace |
| **Day 3** | Chicane Accuracy Drill | Same line 10 laps in a row |
| **Day 4** | Race Consistency Validation | Lock in σ < 0.50s |
| **Day 5+** | AI Races → Official | Cold Tire Contract + Meebewegen |

### Week 05 Drills (from Track Guide)

1. **Chicane Accuracy Drill**: Same brake marker, same line across first curb, same steering release before second. Any "hero curb" attempt = mental penalty.

2. **T1 Survival Script**: No lunges from more than one car length back. Lift early, straighten, late apex, drive off clean.

3. **Long Runs for Rhythm**: 20+ min stint. Notice how braking references shift. Catch "just a bit deep" habits before they stack up.

## The Mindset

**"Hit the same mark ten times."**

Oschersleben rewards boring precision over spectacular heroics. In the Ray FF1600, you don't have the power to recover from sloppy exits. Every 2-3 km/h mistake stacks up.

The goal: make it feel clinically precise, not stressful. Fifty small things right in a row.

## Coming From Week 04

**What Worked:**
- Chapter 16 Edge Mapping → 82% S3 consistency improvement
- Cold Tire Contract → 4 patient races = 4 wins
- Meebewegen → Top Split P3 with 0 incidents
- Consistency creates traffic → Protected P3 from faster P4

**Apply Here:**
- Edge Mapping Drill on Day 2 (McDonald's chicane especially)
- T1 Survival Script from race 1 (it's a chaos magnet)
- Same consistency weapon: be uncatchable, let traffic protect you
