## The Story

There's a particular cruelty to Oschersleben. It sits on the German plain—flat, featureless, honest—and asks one question over and over: _can you hit your marks?_

Master Lonn arrived with an advantage and a curse. The advantage: GR86 muscle memory from previous seasons. The curse: the FF1600 speaks a different language. Same corners, different vocabulary. And lurking in Sector 1 was a nemesis waiting to introduce itself.

**T2 Hotel Exit.** A long, decreasing-radius, downhill corner where GR86 habits go to die.

Session 2 revealed the scale of the problem: three separate incidents, lap times swinging by 7 seconds, variance at that one corner sitting at **2.257 seconds**. A lottery. A coin flip. A disaster waiting to happen.

_"I remember that being a strange corner from my GR86 times,"_ Master Lonn admitted. Strange was an understatement.

But something remarkable happened over the next 72 hours.

Instead of chasing speed, Master Lonn chased consistency. _"Hit the same mark ten times"_ became the mantra. The data responded. T2 variance plummeted—**97% improvement** from Practice 02 to Race 01. By AI Race 02, the corner was DIALED: **σ 0.066s**. And then came the PB: **1:32.933**—set while defending position for four laps.

The Hotel had been conquered. Or so we thought.

### The Hotel's Revenge

Races 03, 04, and 05 told a different story.

**AI Race 03**: POLE position, leading for 7 laps, then punted at T2 on the final lap. P1 → P10.

**AI Race 04**: P6 → P2. Climbing through the field with the Cold Tire Contract, fighting for the win... and T2 bit on Lap 7. **10.4 seconds** at one corner. The damage was done.

**AI Race 05**: P6 → P2. Same story. L6 and L7 were _identical_—0.016s apart (ELITE consistency). Then Lap 8, the final lap, fighting for P1... T2 struck again. **10.8 seconds**. P1 slipped away.

The pattern was undeniable:

- **T2 in practice**: σ 0.066s (DIALED)
- **T2 in races when fighting**: σ 1.0+ (LOTTERY)

The Hotel doesn't negotiate. When someone's contesting that corner, everything falls apart.

### The Breakthrough (January 11)

And then, during a practice session testing wheelbase settings—not even trying to go fast—Master Lonn found something.

**1:32.907.** NEW PB.

More importantly, he found the _technique_:

> _"Little trail braking into the corner, then full on the brakes, quickly shift 4 to 3 to 2. Then 20% gas until I can exit... slowly on the gas to 100."_

That 20% throttle hold through the apex. That's the key. The FF1600's rear gets light when you're off-throttle going downhill into a decreasing radius. The 20% keeps weight on the rear. Stabilizes the car. Prevents the snap that's been costing positions.

**The Hotel Technique:**

1. Trail brake entry (front loaded, rotation begins)
2. Full brake + quick downshift 4→3→2
3. **20% throttle HOLD through apex** ← The secret
4. Progressive throttle to 100% on exit

Never fully off throttle through the apex. That's the fix.

### The Hotel Rule

Four consecutive races where T2 cost potential wins. The lesson is clear:

**Don't fight for P1 at T2.** If contested:

- Let them have T2 → attack at Triple complex (T3-T6)
- Let them have T2 → set up slipstream for T14→main straight
- If genuinely faster → Meebewegen 2.0 (let them go)

The Hotel is where you LOSE, not where you WIN.

## Breakthroughs 🎯

- **T2 Hotel Exit Technique SOLVED**: Trail brake → Full brake → 4→3→2 → 20% throttle HOLD → Progressive exit. The 20% hold stabilizes the rear on the downhill decreasing-radius corner. Master Lonn reverse-engineered what the VRS aliens do.

- **1:33.0 Barrier Crushed**: Goal was -0.167s from PB. Delivered **-0.911s**. Now 1:32.907.

- **14/14 Corners Dialed**: First track this season with complete corner mastery in practice conditions.

- **Steering Smoothness Progression**: 12.98 → 11.43 → 10.15 → 10.98 rad/s². Consistently under 11 now. Neural rewiring confirmed.

- **PB Under Non-Focus Conditions**: The 1:32.907 came while testing wheelbase settings, not hot-lapping. When you stop trying so hard, speed comes anyway.

---

## Challenges 🚧

- **T2 Under Race Pressure**: Practice = DIALED (σ 0.066s). Races when fighting = LOTTERY (σ 1.0+). The technique is known now—deployment under pressure is the test.

- **The Hotel Rule**: Four races cost by T2. New strategy: don't fight there. Fight everywhere else.

- **Gap to Alien (Gong)**: 1.51s remaining. Closing, but not there yet. Main loss zones: Hotel entry (braking 50m early), Zeppelin exit (commitment).

- **Official Race Pending**: AI races validated the approach AND revealed the weakness. Ready to deploy—with Hotel awareness.

## What We Learned

**Technical:**

- T2 Hotel Exit Formula: 20% throttle hold through apex prevents rear snap on downhill decreasing-radius corners
- VRS Hotel technique validated: Turn FIRST, brake SECOND. Initial brake 25-30% only.
- Consistency-first paradoxically produces speed. Focus on repeatability → confidence → natural limit-finding.

**Mental:**

- "Shaky but not scary" is the intermediate state between fear and mastery
- PBs can come when NOT focused on going fast. The wheelbase testing session proves it.
- Pressure at contested corners is different from general race pressure. T2 requires specific mental management.

**Strategic:**

- **The Hotel Rule**: Don't fight for P1 at T2. Let battles happen there, attack elsewhere.
- Center line defense: Take center line on straights, deny both sides, force attacker to commit first
- Cold Tire Contract still works: P6→P2 twice is still +8 positions across two races
