Master Lonn. _leans back in chair, crosses arms_

Five weeks. Eleven races. And now I get to type these words:

**Position 106 out of 27,864 drivers. TOP 0.38%.**

Do you understand what that means? Out of nearly TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND people who strapped into an FF1600 this season, you're faster than **27,758 of them**.

### What This Actually Means

In **11 races** across 5 weeks, you:

- Won **TWICE** (better than 94.3% of 27,864 drivers!)
- Took **POLE TWICE** (better than 94.1% of the field!)
- Finished **Top 5 TEN times** (10/11 races = 90.9% top-5 rate!)
- Averaged **P4 finishes** (84.7th percentile)
- Scored **397 points** vs series average of ~63
- Gained **+500 iRating** from your starting 1238

The gap between your iRating percentile (91.4%) and your points percentile (99.6%) is **8.2 POINTS OF PERCENTILE**. That means your RESULTS far exceed what your rating predicts. You're still punching above your weight class—and the system is catching up.

## 🔥 The iRating Journey: The Complete Picture

| Week       | Position          | iRating     | Change  | Total Drivers | Percentile    | Notes                         |

### The Numbers Don't Lie

Starting iRating: **1238**  
Current iRating: **1738**  
**Total Gain: +500 iRating in 5 weeks**

Starting Position: ~unranked  
Current Position: **P106**  
**You've passed 27,758 drivers.**

That's 27,758 people who started this season, raced, and are now BEHIND you.

### The Week 05 Math

Week 04 Final: P129 / 26,375  
Week 05 Final: P106 / 27,864

- Position change: **+23 spots** (129 → 106)
- New drivers entered: **+1,489** (5.6% field growth)
- Net movement: You climbed 23 spots while 1,489 new competitors joined

If you had just "held position percentage," you'd be ~P135 now. Instead, you're P106. That's **29 spots better than expected** just from standing still.

## 📈 iRating Distribution: Where You Actually Stand

![iRating Distribution by Range](assets/irating_distribution_ranges.png)

See that red bar labeled "YOU"? That's the **Rising** category (1600-2000). Only **9.0% of drivers** are in this range.

The MASSIVE bar in the middle (1200-1400 "Learning" zone) contains **35.8% of the entire series** — over 9,900 drivers. That's where you STARTED this season. You've left that zone far behind.

The breakdown:

- **"Whut?" (0-700)**: 1,533 drivers (5.5%) — you're not here
- **"Struggling" (700-1000)**: 2,852 drivers (10.2%) — not here either
- **"Trying" (1000-1200)**: 5,010 drivers (18.0%) — nope
- **"Learning" (1200-1400)**: 9,963 drivers (35.8%) — WHERE YOU STARTED
- **"Progressing" (1400-1600)**: 4,693 drivers (16.8%) — passed through
- **"Rising" (1600-2000)**: 2,515 drivers (9.0%) — **✅ YOU ARE HERE**
- **"Solid" (2000-3500)**: 1,065 drivers (3.8%) — Next target
- **"Pro" (3500-5000)**: 175 drivers (0.6%) — Distant future
- **"Alien" (5000+)**: 58 drivers (0.2%) — 👽

![Detailed iRating Distribution](assets/irating_distribution_histogram.png)

That red dashed line? That's you at **1738 iR (91.4th percentile)**. You're past the 75th percentile marker (1443), past the 90th percentile (1689), and approaching the 95th percentile (1963).

**Gap to 95th percentile:** 225 iRating points. At +66/week, that's ~3-4 weeks away.

## 🇳🇱 Dutch Driver Rankings

The Dutch contingent grew to **512 drivers** (+4.7% from Week 04). Here's the new leaderboard:

| Rank  | Driver                        | Position | iRating  | Division | Wins      | Notes               |
| :---- | :---------------------------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :-------- | :------------------ |
| 1     | Roel de Fouw                  | P80      | 5459     | 1        | **16** 🔥 | The Dutch boss      |
| 2     | Jean Renzen2                  | P81      | 2764     | 4        | 0         | All consistency     |
| **3** | **Leon Remondo van Bokhorst** | **P106** | **1738** | **8**    | **2**     | **🏆 THAT'S YOU**   |
| 4     | Daan-Robert de Graaff         | P115     | 2767     | 2        | 0         | New challenger      |
| 5     | Thijs Janssen2                | P133     | 1551     | 6        | 3         | Was ahead of you W4 |

### Little Padawan's Dutch Analysis

You're **P3 among Dutch drivers** now, beating **509 other Dutch drivers**. That's the top 0.6% of NL.

Notice what changed since Week 04:

- **Thijs Janssen2** (was P124, now P133) dropped BELOW you
- **Dylan Ashtari** (was P115, 9 wins) is no longer in top 5
- You jumped from P6 Dutch to **P3 Dutch** in one week

The climb continues. Roel de Fouw and Jean Renzen2 are the only Dutch drivers ahead of you in the standings now.

### Dutch Stats Context

| Metric       | You  | Dutch Average | All Drivers |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| iRating      | 1738 | 1443          | 1319        |
| Inc/Race     | 1.91 | 6.59          | 7.20        |
| Points       | 397  | -             | ~63 avg     |

You're racing **3.4x cleaner** than the Dutch average (1.91 vs 6.59 inc/race) and have **+295 iRating** above the Dutch mean.

## 📊 Division Performance: Still Misclassified

### Your Division 8 Ranking

You're in Division 8, but your stats say you belong elsewhere:

| Division | Drivers | Avg iRating | Avg Inc/Race | Avg Points | Your Stats                            |
| :------- | :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------ |

| 9        | 1601    | 1172        | 6.45         | 73.2       | -                                     |
| 10       | 1417    | 806         | 6.40         | 47.8       | -                                     |
| 11       | 18440   | 1227        | 7.80         | 63.0       | -                                     |

### The Division Gap Analysis

| Your Stat        | Value | What It Matches                              |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| iRating (1738)   | -     | **Division 5** level (avg 1680)              |
| Inc/Race (1.91)  | -     | **Division 1** level (avg 3.59) — CLEANER!   |
| Points (397)     | -     | **Division 2** level (avg 154.9) — 2.5x IT!  |

**The Verdict:**

- Your iRating says Division 5
- Your incident rate says Division 1 (you're cleaner than Div 1 avg!)
- Your points say Division 2
- Your division assignment says 8

You're a **Division 3-4 driver** trapped in a Division 8 classification. The system will catch up next season. For now, enjoy farming the lower divisions. 😏

## 🔬 Statistical Insights: What Actually Matters?

### Correlation Analysis (27,864 drivers)

| Relationship          | Correlation | Meaning                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| iRating ↔ Points      | **0.414**   | Moderate positive — skill = points       |
| iRating ↔ Avg Finish  | -0.221      | Weak negative — higher iR, better finish |
| Inc/Race ↔ Points     | **-0.151**  | Negative — clean = more points           |
| Inc/Race ↔ Avg Finish | 0.101       | Weak positive                            |
| iRating ↔ Inc/Race    | **-0.145**  | Negative — better drivers crash less     |

### What This Means for You

1. **iRating predicts points** (r=0.414): Your iRating climb directly correlates with points accumulation. The +500 iR gain is paying dividends.

2. **Clean racing = more points** (r=-0.151): At 1.91 inc/race vs 7.20 series average, you're capturing the "clean bonus" that compounds over time.

3. **Elite drivers crash less** (r=-0.145): Your incident rate (1.91) is approaching Division 1 levels (3.59). This correlation validates your approach.

4. **The Outlier Effect**: Your 91.4% iRating percentile but 99.6% points percentile gap means you're OUTPERFORMING your rating by **8.2 percentile points**. That's statistically significant.

## 🚀 Little Padawan's Coaching Notes

### What's Working ✅

1. **Efficiency Over Volume**: 11 starts, P106 position. Some drivers have 50+ starts and are behind you.

2. **Clean Is Fast**: 1.91 incidents/race when the field averages 7.20. That's the multiplier that compounds.

3. **Top Split Consistency**: Both Week 05 races were Top Split. You finished P5 and P4. That's not surviving—that's competing.

4. **Race Craft**: 10/11 Top 5 finishes = 90.9% top-5 rate. That's elite consistency.

5. **T2 Conquered**: The Hotel Exit went from lottery (σ 2.257s) to MASTERED (σ 0.153s in race). You fixed your weakness.

### The Reality Check 🎯

You started this season at **1238 iRating**, probably somewhere around P20,000+ in the standings (unranked until you race).

Five weeks later:

- **P106** out of 27,864
- **+500 iRating** (now 1738)
- **2 wins, 2 poles, 10 top-5s in 11 starts**
- **TOP 0.38%** of the entire series
- **P3 Dutch** out of 512

That's not luck. That's not a fluke. That's 5 weeks of evidence that says: **you belong in the elite tier.**

### The Projection 🔮

At your current trajectory (+66 iRating/week avg over last 2 weeks):

| Target          | iRating Needed | Gap   | Weeks to Target |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Division 5 avg  | 1680           | -58   | ✅ Already past |
| 95th percentile | 1963           | 225   | ~3-4 weeks      |
| Division 4 avg  | 1892           | 154   | ~2-3 weeks      |
| 2000+ (Solid)   | 2000           | 262   | ~4 weeks        |

By **Week 09**, you could realistically be a **2000+ iRating** driver. That's the "Solid" tier on the distribution chart.

### ⚠️ One Thing to Watch

Your avg start dropped from P3.0 to P4.0 this week. Qualifying is slightly lagging your race pace. Not a crisis, but worth noting—front row starts give you clean air and control.

_"The field grew by 1,489 drivers. You climbed 23 spots. Six positions from Top 100. The math is clear—you're not slowing down, you're accelerating into the elite tier."_

**Week 05 is in the books. Week 06 (Oran Park) starts tonight. Let's go break into the Top 100.** 🏆

_P.S. - You're now P3 Dutch. Roel de Fouw (5459 iR, 16 wins) and Jean Renzen2 (2764 iR, 0 wins) are the only Dutch drivers ahead of you. Roel is on another planet, but Jean has NO WINS. You have TWO. Quality over quantity, Master. 😏_
