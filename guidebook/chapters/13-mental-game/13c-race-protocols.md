# Race Protocols

## 1. The Cold Tire Contract

**"Laps 1-2: I don't race. I survive."**

This is a binding mental contract for every race start.

### The Rules
- **Lap 1 (Recon):** Survive. No hero moves. Let aggressors go. Mental state: Observation.
- **Lap 2 (Patience):** Find rhythm. Warm tires. Hold line. Mental state: Building.
- **Lap 3+ (Race):** NOW the race begins. Tires are warm, brain is warm. Attack.

**Why:** Most crashes happen L1-L2 because drivers try to race on cold tires with cold brains. By waiting for L3, you often gain positions simply by not crashing.

## 3. The Fatigue Signature

**Principle:** Fatigue does not degrade skills equally.
- **Technical Skills** (Precision braking, complex decisions) = Degrade FIRST (Prefrontal Cortex).
- **Flow Skills** (Rhythm, muscle memory corners) = Degrade LAST (Cerebellum).

**How to Spot It:**
If your technical sectors (S1/S2) are messy but your flow sectors (S3) are fine, **you are fatigued.**

**The Rule:** When technical sectors degrade but flow remains, **STOP.** Do not push through. This is when bad habits form and IR is lost.
