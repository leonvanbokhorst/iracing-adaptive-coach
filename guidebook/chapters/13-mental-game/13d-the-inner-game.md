# The Inner Game

## 1. The Confidence Equation

```
Confidence = (Preparation × Past Success) / Fear of Failure
```

**How to Build It:**
1. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Executing a drill perfectly is a win. Staying calm is a win.
2. **Document Progress:** Read your own session logs. The data proves you are improving.
3. **Identity vs. Performance:**
   - Bad: "I am slow." (Permanent identity)
   - Good: "That lap was slow." (Temporary performance)

## 2. Success vs. Satisfaction (The Trap)

**Success** = Objective achievement (P137 / 30,000).
**Satisfaction** = Subjective feeling ("I want P50").

**The Trap:** If confidence relies on satisfaction, you will never be confident because the goalposts always move.

**The Fix:** Separate them.
- **Acknowledge Success:** "Top 0.4% is elite." (Feed Confidence)
- **Use Dissatisfaction:** "I want Top 0.1%." (Feed Drive)

**"Do not let the Dissatisfaction eat the Success."**

## 3. Surfing the Urge (Breaking Habits)

**The Monk's Secret:** Fighting a habit gives it power.
- "Don't divebomb!" -> Tension -> Divebomb.

**The Strategy: Surf the Wave**
1. **Observe:** "Ah, the Hero Urge is here."
2. **Wait:** Watch it peak. It only lasts seconds.
3. **Act:** Brake at the normal marker.
4. **Release:** "Goodbye, urge."

**The Forest Path (Neuroplasticity)**
- **Old Path (Bad Habit):** Wide, paved, easy.
- **New Path (Good Habit):** Overgrown, hard.
- You can't "erase" the Old Path. You can only ignore it until it grows over, while deliberately trampling the grass on the New Path.
