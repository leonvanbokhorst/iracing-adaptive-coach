# Chapter 13: The Mental Game

**"The fastest driver is the one whose mind doesn't get in the way."**

You spend hours perfecting the car setup. But there's one piece of equipment you barely think about: **your brain**.

Your brain is the processing unit, prediction engine, and decision maker. A poorly-tuned brain will cost you more lap time than a poorly-tuned car.

This chapter covers the "invisible skill" of racing: managing focus, fear, habits, and your own nervous system.
