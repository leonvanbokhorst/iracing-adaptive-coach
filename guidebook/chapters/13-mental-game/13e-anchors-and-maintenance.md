# Anchors & Maintenance

## 1. The Opening Ritual (Music Anchor)

**Goal:** Shift nervous system from **Contracted** (Anxious/Tight) to **Expanded** (Open/Flow).

**The Sequence (Before Sim Load):**
1. **Close Noise:** Phone silent, apps closed.
2. **Physical Reset:** Shoulders back, jaw unclenched.
3. **The Opening:** Play **Zero 7 - Somersault**.
   - Focus: Creating space. Letting go of tension.
4. **The Deepening:** Play **Zero 7 - Home (Acoustic)**.
   - Focus: Connection. "Cry but strong."
5. **The Transition:** "I'm here. Let's drive."

**Why it works:** Classical conditioning. The song becomes the trigger for the flow state.

## 2. The Pit Crew Protocol (Nervous System Maintenance)

**The Driver IS the Car.**
If the engine (body) is misfiring and the ECU (brain) is overheated, the setup doesn't matter.

### Protocol Components

1. **The Garage Closes (Sleep)**
   - Hard stop time for screens.
   - Sleep is when neuroplasticity (learning) happens.

2. **Fuel Map (Nutrition)**
   - Don't run lean (hungry) or rich (sugar crash).
   - Hydration is mandatory.

3. **The 10-Minute Idle (Meditation)**
   - Just sit. Watch thoughts pass like cars.
   - **Why:** Practicing "Surfing the Urge" offline makes it easier to do online.

**Master Lonn's Commitment:**
"I am the machine. I require maintenance."
