# Resilience & Fear

## 1. The Enemy: Fear

**Flow = Reacting to NOW.**
**Fear = Reacting to MAYBE.**

When you fear (spinning, losing position), you tense up.
**Fear → Tension → Tight Inputs → Mistakes → More Fear.**

### The Fear Loop (The Pink Elephant)
- Brain: "Don't spin!" -> Brain hears: "SPIN!"
- Brain: "Don't lose P2!" -> Brain hears: "LOSE!"
- **The Fix:** Focus on the POSITIVE action in the PRESENT.
  - Not: "Don't spin."
  - Instead: "Where is the grip right now?"

**Drill: "Let Them By"**
- Practice being overtaken in AI races.
- Let them pass. Follow them. Observe.
- Desensitize the fear of "losing a spot."

## 2. The 10-Second Rule (For Mistakes)

When you make a mistake, do not spiral.

1. **Seconds 1-5 (Acknowledge):** "I spun. That happened."
2. **Seconds 6-10 (Analyze):** "Braked too late. Note: brake earlier."
3. **Second 11 (Release):** "Next lap."

**Why:** It extracts the lesson without keeping the emotional baggage.

## 3. The Reset (Recovering from Contact)

Contact causes an adrenaline spike. You have two bad choices and one good one:
1. **Victim Mode:** "Race ruined." (Give up)
2. **Rage Mode:** "Revenge!" (Overdrive -> Crash)
3. **Focus Mode:** "Free energy!" (Sharpen focus)

**Adrenaline is fuel.** Use it for sharpness, not aggression.

### Protocol: Contact Recovery
1. **Sec 1-3:** Regain control.
2. **Sec 4-5:** Say "Reset. Focus."
3. **Sec 6-10:** Find next brake marker.
4. **Lap 1:** Drive 90%. No hero moves.
5. **Lap 2+:** Resume race pace.

**Master Lonn's Insight:**
> "It's not about the contact. It's about what you do in the 10 seconds after."
