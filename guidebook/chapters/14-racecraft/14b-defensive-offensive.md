# Chapter 13b: Defensive & Offensive Tactics

**How to defend your position and overtake cleanly**

---

## Part 1: Defensive Driving

### The One-Move Rule

**Official rule:** One defensive move per straight.

**What this means:**
- You can move to defend once
- You cannot weave back and forth
- You cannot move under braking (dangerous)

**How to defend properly:**

**Early Defense:**
Position your car to defend BEFORE the straight ends.
- Approaching Turn 3 and want inside line?
- Move to inside BEFORE the brake zone
- Commit to that line

**Late Defense:**
Moving late = dangerous = penalties.

### Defending a Corner

**The Inside Line Advantage:**
- Controls corner entry
- Forces attacker to go around (longer path)
- BUT: Often sacrifices optimal racing line

**When to defend:**
- Corners leading to long straights (protect exit)
- Late in race with position on the line
- When you KNOW they're attempting a pass

**When NOT to defend:**
- Early in race (long race ahead)
- Against much faster car (they'll get you anyway)
- When defense ruins your own pace

**Master Lonn's future application:**
When racing starts, recognizing WHEN to defend vs. when to yield = key skill.

## Part 2: Offensive Driving (Overtaking)

### The Overtake Hierarchy (Safest to Riskiest)

**1. The DRS/Slipstream Pass (Safest)**
- Use draft to gain speed on straight
- Pull alongside before brake zone
- Complete pass before turn-in

**Risk:** Low. You're faster, physics helps.

**2. The Out-Brake Pass**
- Brake later than opponent
- Carry more speed to apex
- Position car on inside

**Risk:** Medium. Requires precision.

**3. The Switchback**
- Opponent takes early apex (mistake)
- You take late apex (correct line)
- Exit with more speed, repass on straight

**Risk:** Medium. Requires patience and positioning.

**4. The Dive Bomb (AVOID)**
- Brake stupidly late on inside
- Hope opponent yields
- Usually ends in contact

**Risk:** HIGH. Causes incidents. Don't do this.

### How to Set Up a Clean Pass

**Step 1: Pressure (2-3 laps before)**
- Stay close, within 0.5s
- Show your nose in corners
- Make them aware of your presence

**Why:** Pressure causes mistakes. A defender under pressure makes errors.

**Step 2: Identify the Overtake Zone**
- Look for corners where defender is weak
- Check telemetry if available (where are they slow?)
- Plan to attack THERE, not everywhere

**Step 3: The Setup Lap**
- Get even closer on the lap before
- Exit the previous corner as strong as possible
- Build momentum for the overtake

**Step 4: Execute**
- Commit to the move
- Brake late but controlled
- Claim the apex
- Don't hesitate once committed

**Step 5: Complete the Pass**
- Don't celebrate until you're fully clear
- Give space on exit (avoid contact)
- Move to racing line for next corner

## Part 3: Situational Awareness

### The Three Mirrors

**Rear-view:** What's directly behind  
**Left mirror:** Who's on your left  
**Right mirror:** Who's on your right

**When to check:**
- Entering every brake zone
- Before defensive moves
- After completing passes
- On straights (not in corners!)

**ADHD Adaptation:**
Set a mental trigger: "Every brake zone = check mirrors."

### The Awareness Zones

**Zone 1: 2 car lengths (Critical)**
- Car here = immediate threat/opportunity
- Must account for them in your driving
- Any move affects both of you

**Zone 2: 5 car lengths (Tactical)**
- Car here = planning phase
- Set up overtake or defense
- Monitor their pace

**Zone 3: 10+ car lengths (Strategic)**
- Car here = no immediate concern
- Focus on your own pace
- Periodically check if they're closing

**Focus rule:**
Most of your attention = Zone 1.  
Some attention = Zone 2.  
Minimal attention = Zone 3.

### Vision in Traffic: The X-Ray Gaze

**The Principle:**

When following another car closely, your instinct is to stare at their gearbox. This is wrong.

**The technique:** Look THROUGH the car ahead, not AT it.

**How it works:**
- Your eyes focus on the track (the apex, brake marker, exit)
- The car ahead exists in your **peripheral vision**
- You read their "body language" (movement, brake lights) without fixating

**Why it matters:**
- Staring at their car = reactive driving (you follow their mistakes)
- Looking through = proactive driving (you drive YOUR line)
- Peripheral processing is faster than central vision for threat detection

**Master Lonn's Discovery (Winton, Week 03):**

During the Shadow Protocol training, Master Lonn found the secret to close following:

> "Looking through the cars in front... focused on the track... cars were in the outskirts of my vision."

**The result:**
- Maintained 0.2-0.5s gaps without panic
- Could follow for 5+ laps without losing focus
- Flow state preserved even in heavy traffic

**The Data Proof:**
- Shadow Protocol R3: "Kissed guy in front" (0x) - good proximity, no contact
- Post-contact laps: 0.26s sigma = alien-level consistency while in traffic
- Mental state: "Flow preserved" despite cars everywhere

**Practice the X-Ray Gaze:**

1. In AI race or practice, follow a car for 3 laps
2. Force your eyes to focus on the TRACK, not the car
3. Notice: You can still "see" the car, but you're not staring at it
4. Check: Are your hands lighter? Are you less tense?

**Success criteria:**
- Following feels "calm" instead of "chasing"
- You're hitting YOUR apex, not copying theirs
- Brake lights don't trigger panic (you see them peripherally)

**Key insight:**
The car ahead is an obstacle. The track is your target. Focus on the target.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **One defensive move per straight** - Commit early, don't weave

✅ **Overtake hierarchy** - Slipstream > Out-brake > Switchback > ❌ Dive-bomb

✅ **Clean pass = 5 steps** - Pressure → Identify zone → Setup → Execute → Complete

✅ **Check mirrors every brake zone** - Situational awareness prevents incidents

✅ **Awareness zones** - Most attention on Zone 1 (2 car lengths)

## Practice Drills

### Drill 1: The "Shadow Lap"

**Goal:** Learn to race in traffic without actual racing.

**Setup:**
- Join practice session with other drivers
- Find someone at similar pace
- Follow them for 5-10 laps

**Practice:**
- Stay 0.5-1.0s behind (race distance)
- Predict their moves
- Study where they brake, turn-in, apex
- Imagine overtake opportunities

**Don't actually overtake.**

**Why:**
Builds awareness without pressure. You learn to "see" racecraft.

### Drill 2: AI Race Practice

**Goal:** Practice overtaking in low-stakes environment.

**Setup:**
- AI race, medium difficulty
- 10-15 minute race
- Goal: Make 3 clean passes using proper zones

**Focus:**
- Use overtake hierarchy (no dive-bombs)
- Complete passes cleanly (no contact)
- Check mirrors before/after each pass
