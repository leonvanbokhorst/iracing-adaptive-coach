    "Mental State (Week 06): Struggling to accept objective success (P137) due to subjective dissatisfaction ('I want to be better'). The challenge is behaving according to the 'Success vs Satisfaction' rule—separating the two emotions. Sleep and distance recommended.",
    "Data Lesson (Weekly vs Season): Confusion arose between Week 04 'P65' (Weekly Standing, small sample) vs Week 05 'P137' (Season Standing, cumulative). High numbers in Season Standings are harder to achieve than Low numbers in Weekly Standings. P137 Season > P65 Weekly.",
    "Stupid Hero Paradox (Race 02): Pace (1:11.900) and Consistency (0.619s σ) were sufficient for P1. The loss came from 'Hero Moves' (Lap 9 overdrive). Validates that 'trying to win' is slower than 'driving to win'. Boring wins are the goal.",
    "Yokohama Commitment vs Coca-Cola Trying (NEW): Yokohama σ 0.039s (Best) vs Coca-Cola σ 0.344s (Worst). Why? At Yokohama, driver COMMITS ('pick exit, point, hold'). At Coca-Cola, driver TRIES (brakes late, scrubs tires, oversteers). Commitment > Effort.",
    "LF Tire Scrubbing (Coca-Cola): LF Outside Temp (79.1C) > Inside (71.3C) indicates heavy understeer/scrubbing in right-handers. Cause: aggressive turn-in/late braking at Coca-Cola/Shell. Fix: earlier brake, smooth entry, let fronts grip before loading.",
    "Brake Bias Protocol (Winton): Start 57.5% (stability on cold tires). Click down (2 clicks) to 56.5% after L3+ as tires warm up and rotation is needed. 56.5% is the floor.",
    "Vision Technique: 'Looking through the car' is the key to proximity. Focus on track, treat car ahead as peripheral obstacle. Enables flow state in traffic.",
    "Proximity Gap: 0.2s feels risky but is safer than 0.4s+ because it prevents 'gap panic' when leader brakes. Being closer means reacting to their car body language, not just brake lights.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: PROVEN. Giving up pace in L1-L3 (Survival Mode) allows for 'Alien Mode' in L4+ once tires/nerves settle. Resulted in P11 -> P1 drive.",
    "Quali Reality: Race pace (1:26.2) > Quali pace (1:26.8) is normal due to tire physics. Everyone is faster in race. The goal is not to match race pace, but to maximize cold tire grip relative to field.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
    "REALITY CHECK (Alien Pace): 1:25.7 is great, but 1:24.0 (Eric Wong) is the true Alien benchmark. 1.7s gap remains. 0.7s to just break into 1:24s.",
    "Efficiency Maxed (0.08s Gap): Gap to theoretical optimal is only 0.08s. This means the 'easy speed' is gone. Further gains require moving the limit (better line/technique), not just reducing errors.",
    "Fatigue & Precision: Fatigue degrades Technical Sectors (S1, S2) first. Flow Sectors (S3, S4) relying on muscle memory remain robust. When tired, 'Robot Mode' works in flow, but fails in precision.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Flow): In high-stress Top Split, 'going with the flow' (Meebewegen) rather than fighting for every inch yields better consistency (0.36s) and speed than aggression.",
    "Momentum Chaining (Lime Rock): On short tracks like Lime Rock, corners chain together. A poor T1 kills T2 which kills T3. One throttle commit, one brake, flow through. The track rewards rhythm over heroics.",
    "Compression Grip (T5 Uphill): Uphill transitions load front tires naturally. Panic-braking wastes this 'free grip'. Lift-only entry + early throttle commit = faster than heavy braking.",
    "S3 Variance Pattern: When S3 σ is 4-7x higher than other sectors, it's a bravery/consistency problem, not technique. The fast laps prove the skill exists - now make it repeatable.",
    "Chapter 16 (Spatial Awareness) VALIDATED: Edge Mapping Drill (Practice 03: slow edge-finding at 70% pace) → Race Pace Validation (Practice 04: normal session) resulted in 56% S3 consistency improvement (0.416s → 0.183s σ) AND new PB (56.238s). Proof: addressing spatial fear ('30cm buffer tax') directly improves both consistency and pace. Theory-to-practice cycle = 3 hours (chapter written morning, applied morning, validated afternoon).",
    "Negative Gap to Optimal (-0.011s): When best lap beats theoretical optimal (best sectors combined), it means momentum carry through sector boundaries is working. Not just hitting checkpoints—flowing through entire lap. This is 'lap-level' optimization vs 'sector-level' optimization.",
    "Telemetry Comparison (Gong vs Master Lonn - Lime Rock GP): 0.541s gap. Key findings: (1) T5 (uphill) is NOW FASTER (+1.87 km/h vs Gong) - Chapter 16 validated in competition context. (2) T1 is biggest loss zone (-13.94 km/h) tied to T9 exit speed. (3) Max lateral G: Gong 3.16G vs Master 2.28G (0.88G gap) = not at tire limit yet, room to push harder. (4) Brake authority: Gong uses 92.3% vs Master 75.8% - not using full brake potential. (5) Faster on 43% of lap (competitive), slower on 57% (concentrated in 3 zones: T1, T6/T7, straight).",
    "Cornering Grip Headroom: Max lateral G comparison reveals driver is using 2.28G when car is capable of 3.16G (Gong proves it). That's 0.88G (28%) of untapped cornering potential. This is technique-limited, not car-limited. Building confidence in higher cornering loads is the next frontier after consistency is locked in.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0 Win Streak (3/3 UPDATED): Winton AI Race (P11→P1), Lime Rock AI Race 1 (P5→P1), Lime Rock AI Race 2 (P6→P1). The contract works consistently: survive L1-L3 at 80-85% pace (let tires/nerves settle), then deploy race pace L4+ when field spreads. This strategy converts mid-pack starts into victories by avoiding early chaos and capitalizing on mistakes ahead. Proven across two different tracks and three consecutive victories.",
    "Exit Speed as Overtaking Weapon (Lime Rock T7): Better exit from The Diving Turn (T7) directly translated to slipstream passes on the main straight into T1. Driver quote: 'Faster exit out of the last corner, slip stream, bam.' This validates the Week 04 exit speed focus—it's not just lap time, it's racecraft. Exit advantage → drag reduction → clean pass. The physics work.",
    "Consistency Transfer to Pressure (Practice → Race): Practice σ 0.367s → Race σ ~0.43s. The consistency built in practice holds under race pressure (traffic, positioning, strategy). Only +0.06s degradation despite added variables. This proves the mental/technical foundation is solid. Repeatability isn't just hot-lapping—it's deployable in competition.",
    "Brake Authority Under Pressure: Practice max brake 75.8% → Race max brake 77.7%. Pressure situations (defending, attacking, traffic) unlock higher commitment levels than solo practice.

S2 (Esses) σ 0.096s in traffic proves precision holds even in tight sections with opponents nearby.",
    "Routine = Professional (NEW): Driver's post-race comment 'Felt more routine' is not diminishing praise. It's the opposite. It means the driver executed a proven system (Cold Tire Contract) without panic, drama, or overthinking. Indicates maturity in racecraft. Non-routine wins involve heroics. Routine wins involve repetition of proven strategy. Growth.",
    "Racecraft vs Raw Pace (NEW): Race 02 fastest lap 56.955s is 0.283s slower than practice PB 56.238s. The gap is entirely due to traffic/positioning/strategy, not loss of pace. This means racecraft (reading overtakes, positioning for passes, defending) is being deployed at the cost of raw lap time. This is correct in races. Validates that driver understands the difference between 'hot-lapping solo' and 'racing with others.'",
    "Meebewegen Validated by Contrast (Race 03): Driver ran deliberate aggression experiment. Results: 4 races with patience = 4 wins (P1, P1, P1, P1). 1 race with aggression = P2 + rear-ended. Driver self-diagnosis: 'Being strategic like a ninja is way more effective and calm.' The fastest lap (56.655s) came on Lap 11 AFTER chaos settled. Pace doesn't need aggression—it needs SPACE. This is now proven from both directions: patience works, aggression doesn't.",
    "S1 (Big Bend) as Conflict Zone: When racing aggressively, S1 variance exploded (0.607s vs S2's 0.186s). Big Bend is where passes happen at Lime Rock, and forcing the issue there costs rhythm and consistency. The aggression tax is paid in S1.",
    "Meebewegen Official Validation (NEW): First official Top Split race (SoF 2035) deployed 'let faster guy through' strategy. Result: P3 podium preserved, 0 incidents, +71 iRating.

P4 (Pears) had 0.25s more pace but got stuck behind P5 (Nakao) for half the race. Nakao couldn't catch Master Lonn, so he became a rolling roadblock. By the time Pears got clear, the gap was insurmountable. Consistency → Traffic jam behind → Position protected.",

Slow gradually = optimal. Quick decel = losing lap time.' The Hotel is the LONGEST braking zone of the lap (5-6 seconds). Technique: (1) Turn 2-3 car lengths before access road, (2) Initial brake 25-30% only, (3) Release to ~10% through kink, (4) Stay in 4th gear through T1 (no downshifts!), (5) Reserve bulk of braking for straighter section between T1-T2, (6) Overlap throttle with brakes during downshifts to stabilize rear, (7) Downshift to 1st by T2 apex.

    "Low-Stakes Races as Test Sessions (NEW): AI Race 02 competition was weak initially, but required 4 laps of defensive driving (L5-L8). Master Lonn deployed center line defense (first time ever) and set PB (1:32.933) on Lap 7 WHILE defending. This disproves 'PBs need relaxed mind' — pace can come from competitive pressure too.",
    "Center Line Defense (NEW TECHNIQUE): First time Master Lonn used deliberate defensive positioning. Technique: Take center line on straights/approaches, denying clean overtake on both inside AND outside. Forces attacker to commit to a side, allows defender to react.

    "Lift-on-Steer Pattern (NEW): IBT analysis revealed 'throttle lift when adding steering' pattern — classic commitment issue. T9 Chicane Exit was worst offender (23%). Cause: brain says 'rotation = danger' so foot instinctively lifts. Irony: the lift CAUSES instability (weight transfer forward, light rear). Fix: pick throttle %, HOLD through steering input. 8 laps of focused practice reduced T9 from 23% → 17%. T7 Hairpin went from 10.4% → 0.5% (fully rewired). Pattern can be broken with conscious effort.",
    "Focused Drill Methodology (NEW): Short practice sessions (8-10 laps) with ONE specific focus are more effective than long 'try to be faster' sessions.

    "FFB Tuning (MAIRA 35% → 30%): Reducing FFB strength by 5% resulted in 13% smoother steering overall, up to 29% smoother in tight corners (chicane). Jerk σ dropped from 17.25 to 15.44. Consistency IMPROVED (σ 0.70s → 0.515s) and pace held (nearly matched PB). Strong FFB causes micro-corrections that show up as steering jerk. Less fighting the wheel = more flow. 30% MAIRA strength is the new baseline for FF1600.",

The difference is PRESSURE/TRAFFIC. When someone contests T2: (1) Options reduce (can't take normal line), (2) Braking point shifts (defensive/offensive), (3) Commitment drops (fear of contact). Four consecutive races (Race 03-04-05-AI) had T2 incidents cost potential wins. The solution isn't getting faster at T2 — it's NOT FIGHTING at T2. Fight for P1 everywhere else.",

Champion Curve (blind entry, tightening radius, elevation) is the 'Hotel Exit' equivalent - where laps go to die. Foster's Dip produces 3.3G compression load through the dip. The Sweeper + Coca-Cola are a linked complex. O'Brien Dogleg is flat out. BB 55% produces perfectly balanced tire temps.",
    "New Track Learning Efficiency (NEW): First stint at Oran Park yielded 5-second improvement in 23 minutes (1:17.4 → 1:12.5) despite multiple offs and spins. 6/9 corners SOLID on Day 1 (67% dialed on first contact). The offs at Champion Curve and Foster's Dip were part of the learning process — pushed, found limits, recovered, got faster. PB came on Lap 14 AFTER the drama, not before.",
    "Gong Comparison (Oran Park GP): 2.7s gap to alien (1:12.583 vs 1:09.856). Key findings: (1) The Sweeper is NOT a brake zone - Lonn braking 75% of corner vs Gong 42%, losing 22 km/h through. (2) Champion Curve apex speed 9 km/h slower, lat G 0.21 lower. (3) HIDDEN LOSS at Momo Corner - looked 'consistent' but 11 km/h slower than Gong! (4) Full throttle usage 66.6% vs Gong 72.3% (-5.7%). (5) Overdriving 24% of lap. Top speed identical - gap is ALL corner speed and throttle commitment.",
    "The Sweeper Technique (Oran Park): LIFT, DON'T BRAKE. This corner before Coca-Cola should be taken at 160+ km/h with minimal or no braking. Gong carries 22 km/h more through by treating it as a lift zone, not a brake zone. Master Lonn's instinct to brake here costs ~0.2-0.3s alone.",
    "Champion Curve Mastery (Practice 02 Breakthrough): Single-corner focus for 2 sessions resulted in 92% improvement (0.898s → 0.072s σ). Both Entry and Exit went from lottery/work-needed to DIALED. Apex Exit precision: 0.2m σ (laser). Key technique: feeling-based learning (not overthinking), progressive commitment (cautious early, aggressive later), repetition. This validates 'conquer ONE corner fully before attacking the next' philosophy. Champion Curve is now a reference standard.",

Traded consistency for pace discovery. This is CORRECT for practice. The offs taught where the limit is. Lap 16 proves clean 1:11.617 is achievable. Now job is to repeat it without drama. You can't discover the edge without falling off it a few times.",
    "Sequential Corner Mastery (NEW PRINCIPLE): Conquer ONE corner fully before attacking the next. Champion Curve (Week 06 focus) was mastered in 2 sessions (92% improvement).

Don't fix everything at once—systematic, sequential improvement is faster.",
    "Corners Connecting Validation (NEW): Practice 03 validated Master Lonn's feeling of 'corners connecting.' Data proof: S1, S2, S4, S5 all sub-0.25s σ. 9/12 corners solid or better (75% of track). Steering jerk IMPROVED (15.62 → 14.5 rad/s²) despite pushing harder. This is flow—track becoming a sequence, not isolated corners. The feeling of momentum chaining is now backed by numbers. Consistency in 4/5 sectors means the car is linking sections together smoothly.",

Apex wandering 54.7m (twenty car lengths!), σ 0.413s, speed variance 11.63 km/h, Lap 7 disaster (67.2 km/h vs 120+ km/h normal). It's a blind high-speed kink before Foster's with elevation + no reference point. The 'surprising spins' weren't random—they happened at the TWO lottery corners (Foster's + Yokohama), both sharing: blind entry, high speed, elevation change, no clear reference. This pattern identification is KEY for solving both.",
    "Limit-Finding PB Pattern (NEW): Practice 03 set NEW PB (1:11.200) while having FOUR offs. This isn't contradiction—it's limit-finding. You can't find the edge without crossing it. The clean PB lap (Lap 12) came MID-SESSION, proving the offs taught where the limit is. Then more offs (Lap 14-15) pushing even harder. Result: 0.533s gap to optimal (basically AT the limit now). The remaining 0.45-0.7s lives in just TWO corners (Foster's + Yokohama). This validates the methodology: push, find edge, consolidate, repeat.",

    "75% Track Consistency Milestone (NEW): Practice 03: 9/12 corners solid+ (75%), 4/5 sectors sub-0.25s σ. This is a consistency threshold—when 3/4 of track is dialed, the track stops being 'a series of corners' and becomes 'a flow.' Master Lonn's comment 'I start to find how corners connect' is validated by crossing this 75% threshold. The remaining 25% (Foster's + Yokohama + one sector S3) is where the remaining speed lives. This is late-stage track learning—most of the track is solved, now fine-tuning the hard bits.",
    "Foster's Dip Technique Discovery - Data Validated (NEW): Master Lonn discovered Foster's Entry technique during Practice 03: 'Very light on brakes before the curbs on the left turning in. Don't touch the curbs on the left, guaranteed spin.' Data proof: THREE best times (3.183s, 3.183s, 3.200s) on Laps 12, 17, 22 ALL after discovery. After catastrophic off (Lap 14: 7.867s), he REPEATED best time on Lap 17 - proof of learned technique, not luck. Physics validates it: Foster's has 3.3G compression = free front grip. Heavy braking BEFORE compression overloads fronts. Light braking + early turn-in + trust compression + avoid left curbs = platform stability. The technique chain: (1) Light brake before dip (set platform), (2) Turn in early, (3) Let compression rotate car, (4) Avoid left curbs (no lateral disturbance), (5) Trust grip, commit exit. This is self-discovered technique backed by data.",
    "Brake Bias 56% Discovery (Oran Park, NEW): Master Lonn changed BB from 55% → 56% for Practice 03, noted it felt 'more stable in the beginning.' Physics explanation: 1% more front bias = more front tire loading under braking = sharper turn-in bite + less rear lock-up tendency = more predictable front behavior. This explains: (1) Champion Curve Entry mastery maintained (0.052s σ), (2) Coca-Cola brake σ improved 21% (45.6m → 36.2m), (3) Steering smoothness improved 7% (15.62 → 14.5 rad/s²) despite pushing harder. More front authority = car listens better. The 'stable in the beginning' feeling is REAL - fronts have more braking authority, so turn-in is more predictable. Trade-off: slightly less ultimate braking power (rears not working as hard). For Oran Park (slow/medium corners), 56% is optimal. Setup changes should be validated by feel AND data.",
    "Foster's Dip Mastery Complete (Week 06, UPDATED): P03 self-discovery technique → P04 MUSCLE MEMORY. Entry σ: 0.962s (P03 chaos) → 0.060s (P04 dialed) = 93% improvement. Exit σ: 0.413s (P03 lottery) → 0.042s (P04 dialed) = 90% improvement. Apex precision: 18.5m (P03) → 13.8m Entry, 0.2m Exit (P04). Exit apex precision of 0.2m = TWENTY CENTIMETERS = reference standard. Speed variance Exit: 18.87 km/h (P03) → 4.06 km/h (P04) = 78% improvement. Brake consistency: 5.1m σ (hitting same spot every lap). The technique (light brakes before dip, early turn-in, trust 3.3G compression, avoid left curbs, 20% throttle hold through apex) is now AUTOMATIC. Two-session transformation: discovery (P03) → mastery (P04). Foster's is now a WEAPON for racing (can attack here while others are cautious).",
    "Yokohama Bridge Diagnosis (NEW): The ONLY remaining problem corner (71.6m apex wander, 11.59 km/h speed variance, steering jerk 26.86 rad/s² = HIGHEST of any corner). Issue: treating it like a corner when it's a HIGH-SPEED KINK. Blind entry + elevation change + no clear reference point = second-guessing mid-corner. Peak lat G 3.32G proves car CAN do it—problem is CONFIDENCE, not capability. Fix: (1) Pick EXIT marker (right-side rumble strip), not apex. (2) Point car at exit from entry. (3) One smooth steering input, HOLD IT, done. (4) Lift if needed (don't scrub speed with corrections). Best laps through Yokohama (L16, L18, L22) all had minimal steering jerk + smooth commitment. This is 'point and shoot' not 'turn and apex.' For races: Yokohama is where passes happen (others lift/hesitate, you commit and flow through).",
    "Champion Exit One-Off Pattern (NEW): Lap 10 disaster (12.883s corner vs 2.1s avg = 10 seconds in gravel) was NOT a consistency problem—it was ONE mistake from pushing for PB. Entry was too aggressive (3.333s vs 3.433s avg = faster), carried too much speed into Exit, overloaded fronts, snap oversteer. Champion is a COMPOUND corner—Entry speed dictates Exit grip. This corner was dialed in P02 and P03 (0.052s σ Entry, 0.142s σ Exit). For races: prioritize Exit over Entry (Entry is blind, Exit sets up the straight). Go 2% slower into Entry if needed. Respect the Entry→Exit chain. No drill needed—already know this corner, just don't overdrive it.",

Total: 1.55s improvement in 3 days (4 sessions). Progression shows: (1) Big initial gains from learning track (P01→P02), (2) Technique refinement (P02→P03), (3) Consistency at limit (P03→P04). Each PB was CLEAN (no offs on PB lap itself). P04 PB came on Lap 18 in clear air after recovering from Lap 10 off—shows resilience and ability to refocus. Gap to optimal: 0.533s (P03) → 0.25s (P04) = approaching absolute limit. Remaining time is in Yokohama smoothing (~0.15-0.20s) and Champion consistency (~0.05s). Ready for AI races.",
    "Pre-Race Readiness Indicators (NEW): Master Lonn's self-assessment 'more consistent, more in control' validated by data: 83% of track dialed (10/12 corners), gap to optimal 0.25s, four consecutive PBs, all Week 06 goals achieved. Key race prep indicators: (1) Foster's Dip is a WEAPON (dialed consistency, can attack here). (2) Brake consistency elite (6 corners < 6m σ). (3) Immediate recovery from mistakes (Lap 10 off → Lap 11 back to 1:11.850). (4) Tire temps perfectly balanced (BB 56% optimal, no setup changes needed). (5) Knows where remaining speed lives (Yokohama smoothing, Champion respect). Race strategy: consistency > speed (target 1:11.5-1:12.0 range, not PB hunting), Cold Tire Contract L1-2, deploy pace L3+, overtake at Foster's + main straight, defend at Recaro exit, mental reset if needed ('Just DRIVE'). The work is done—now it's DEPLOYMENT.",
    "First AI Race Reality Check (CRITICAL NEW DISCOVERY): Race 01 at Oran Park. Master Lonn started P1 (quali 1:12.543), finished P4, felt 'not satisfied, AI too good, stuck where started.' DATA TRUTH: Lap 3 race best 1:12.383 = 0.16s FASTER than quali. Pace IS there. Technique deployed BETTER in race than practice: 10/12 corners dialed (Yokohama from 0.251s practice nemesis → 0.088s race weapon = 65% improvement!), Foster's maintained (0.059s σ), smoother steering (15.9 vs 16.1), less oversteer (5,123 vs 12,652 events). What cost P1→P4? ONE corner, ONE lap: Coca-Cola Lap 7 off-track (+2.4s). Root cause: brake drift 37.4m σ (second-guessing under pressure), overdriving when AI close ('go faster' not 'stay consistent'). Laps 2-6 pre-disaster avg 1:13.133 = solid race pace. Lap 8 immediate recovery (1:12.767) = resilience proven. But Laps 9-10 slow (1:15s) = mental reset took 3 laps not 1. THE PATTERN: Simplify under pressure = better (Yokohama). Overthink under pressure = worse (Coca-Cola). The skill isn't trying harder—it's trusting more. Next race addressable: Coca-Cola confidence (~2s), faster mental reset (~2.5s), Lap 2 meebewegen (~1s) = 4-5.5s total (P4→P1-P2). He's not missing speed. He's learning to deploy it under pressure. That's the lesson.",
    "Reference Point Trust Under Pressure (NEW PRINCIPLE for Guidebook Ch14): Coca-Cola brake drift 37.4m σ (105m range!) in Race 01 vs 6.1m σ Shell, 5.1m σ Foster's. When AI close, temptation is brake earlier (caution) or brake later (make up time). Both wrong. Brake at YOUR marker, the practiced one, EVERY lap. Coca-Cola was 0.093s σ in P04 (dialed) → 0.802s σ in Race (lottery) = not skill problem, confidence problem. Foster's stayed 5.1m σ because trusted. Yokohama improved (71.6m → 61.3m) because committed to 'pick exit, point, hold.' The fix: 'Brake at the board' becomes automatic mantra. One marker, one commitment, no thinking. Trust overcomes pressure. This is racecraft foundation.",
    "Better In Race Than Practice Pattern (HUGE): Race 01 technique was BETTER than P04 practice: Yokohama 65% improvement, Champion Exit 93% improvement, steering smoother (15.9 vs 16.1), oversteer down 60% (5,123 vs 12,652). Why? Pressure forced SIMPLIFICATION. 'Pick exit, point, hold' at Yokohama worked BETTER when no time to overthink. Foster's muscle memory deployed (0.059s σ maintained). When he commits to a technique and trusts it, race pressure HELPS by removing overthinking. The lesson: practice dialing in techniques, then trust them to execute BETTER in races. Counterintuitive but data-proven. This is why Yokohama breakthrough happened in Race not Practice. Implications: drilling techniques to automatic (muscle memory) makes them pressure-proof. For next race: Coca-Cola needs same 'automatic trust' treatment.",
    "Race Resilience - Mental Reset is FAST (VALIDATED): Lap 7 disaster (1:17.867 off) → Lap 8 immediate recovery (1:12.767) = 5s gained back proves 'Just DRIVE' mental reset works PERFECTLY. The skill is THERE. Laps 9-10 slow (1:15.0, 1:15.5) was NOT mental issue—Master Lonn clarified he was STUCK IN TRAFFIC, couldn't find overtaking opportunities, picked up 2x incidents trying. Oran Park is hard to pass (he's right). So the lesson isn't 'faster mental reset' (already fast!)—it's 'WHERE to overtake at Oran Park' (Foster's Dip + main straight are weapons, need to deploy them). Mental reset speed = ACHIEVED. Next: racecraft overtaking zones.",
    "Overtaking Difficulty at Oran Park (NEW): Master Lonn's assessment 'hard to overtake' validated by Laps 9-10 (stuck in traffic, 2x incidents from attempts). Track characteristics: narrow, few heavy braking zones, AI competitive. Potential overtaking zones: (1) Foster's Dip complex (he's dialed, can brake later/exit faster), (2) Main straight after Recaro (setup pass through Recaro), (3) Coca-Cola if he can get better exit (but that's his problem corner). For next race: identify specific overtaking plan. Don't wait for AI mistake—CREATE opportunity at Foster's. That's where his weapon lives.",
    "Summit Point Baseline - Muscle Memory Triumph (NEW): First session back at Summit Point after 7 months. OLD PB: 1:17.576. NEW PB: 1:16.150 = 1.426s improvement WITHOUT explicit practice. G61 LEADERBOARD: P232 / 1,045 drivers (Top 22.2%) on baseline session. Master Lonn's self-assessment: 'felt familiar, no fighting.' Data validation: 0.53s σ (solid baseline consistency), 13.04 rad/s² steering jerk (Week 06 smoothness maintained), PERFECT tire temps (BB 65% is optimal, all tires 52.5-53.0°C balanced), zero incidents across 18 flying laps. This proves skill transfer—seven months racing OTHER tracks made him faster at THIS track. Growth compounds. Progressive learning curve: Lap 2 (1:18.0) → Lap 14 (1:16.150) = continuous adaptation. Laps 16-17 within 0.05s of PB proves repeatability at the limit. With 3s still on table (overdriving zones), potential climb to Top 100 or higher.",
    "Summit Point Nemesis Corners Identified (Week 07, NEW): IBT analysis reveals TWO oversteer concentration zones accounting for 88% of all rotation events (8,627 out of 9,801 total): (1) Turn 1 area (10-20% of lap): 2,524 oversteer events, losing time in delta analysis, likely low brake pressure + early braking. (2) Carousel/Esses complex (50-60% of lap): 6,103 oversteer events (62% of ALL events!), losing time in delta analysis, likely lift-on-steer pattern + hesitant throttle. Delta-to-optimal analysis PERFECTLY matches oversteer zones—losing time in EXACT zones where car is rotating. Gap to optimal: 3.039s, primarily living in these two sections. Sequential Mastery framework now has clear targets: Turn 1 → Carousel/Esses → Deploy in races.",
    "Summit Point Setup Perfection on Day 1 (NEW): BB 65% produced textbook tire temps on first session. All four tires within 0.5°C range (52.5-53.0°C), in-out differences ±0.3°C or less, perfect balance front-to-rear and left-to-right. This is Oran Park BB 56% level of first-try perfection. No setup changes needed. Driving style fingerprint: balanced loading, no front scrubbing, no rear spinning. Line is optimal. Weight transfer analysis confirms rear-engine bias (shock deflection: rears 66-67mm range vs fronts 46-47mm), appropriate for FF1600. Setup intuition from Week 05-06 transferring to new tracks.",
    "Summit Point Technique Baseline - Conservative Inputs (Week 07, NEW): Input smoothness analysis reveals room for commitment. Steering: 13.04 rad/s² avg jerk (GOOD - maintaining Week 06 smoothness). Throttle: 65.4% full throttle usage with lift rate (136.6 %/s) MUCH faster than application rate (80.2 %/s) = coming off throttle quickly (caution) but going back on gradually (building confidence). Pattern indicates corner exit uncertainty and fear of rear stepping out (validated by 9,801 oversteer events). Brake: Max 100% used (good), but avg when braking only 49.8% (HALF pedal) = early braking with light pressure, missing platform phase. Potential gains: ~0.8-1.2s/lap in throttle commitment, ~0.6-0.9s/lap in brake authority. Technique is CORRECT for baseline (conservative = smart), now need to progressively push limits at identified nemesis corners.",
    "Summit Point vs Shuning Gong (P4) Comparison - The Commitment Gap (NEW): Gap to P4 (Gong 1:15.048) is 1.102s, NOT 3s. Telemetry comparison reveals: slower 83.9% of lap (only faster 16.1%). This is NOT talent gap - it's COMMITMENT gap. Three addressable zones: (1) Carousel entry (~0.4-0.5s): Max loss -13.13 km/h @ 48.5% lap. Master braking 35% pressure vs Gong 50%, loading tires 0.47g vs Gong 0.84g (44% LESS cornering force!), still braking when Gong on throttle. UNDER-driving, not overdriving. Fix: brake harder (50%+), brake later, load to 0.8g+. (2) Brake authority (~0.2-0.3s): Master max -1.49g braking vs Gong -1.78g (-0.28g less force), braking 10.7% of lap vs Gong 13.4% (-2.7% less time), max pressure 82% vs Gong 98% (-16% less authority), only 5 brake zones vs Gong's 7. Fix: 70-80% platform phase, brake 10-20m later, complete braking sooner. (3) Throttle commitment (~0.1-0.2s): Master 71.1% full throttle vs Gong 77.6% (-6.5% less), overdriving 24.7% of lap (more steering, less grip), steering efficiency 11.5 g/deg vs Gong 12.4 g/deg (-7.5% less efficient). Fix: 20% throttle floor, commit through rotation, trust car. Total addressable: 0.9-1.3s (entire gap). Gong proves car CAN handle more: higher brake force, higher cornering loads, more throttle. Master has skill (mid-Esses shows 1.40g vs Gong 1.34g when committed) but applies aggression in WRONG places. Need to commit MORE at brake zones/Carousel entry, chill out where already pushing (mid-Esses).",
    "Summit Point T5 Coasting Technique - EXPERT Coach Validated (Jan 21, BREAKTHROUGH): Focused practice session testing EXPERT coach T5 Carousel Entry technique (coast into corner, NO trail braking). RESULT: 59% oversteer reduction (6,103 events baseline → 2,479 events today) = 3,624 fewer events. The data PROVES the technique: trail braking into T5 unloads rear on banked, low-grip corner = snap oversteer. Coasting (no trail braking) keeps weight balanced = stable rear. Master Lonn's feeling ('works as intended') matches data perfectly. This is now CODIFIED technique for Summit Point T5, ready for race deployment. Corner σ still 0.519s ('lottery' rating) but IMPROVING - need more reps to dial in, but technique is SOUND.",
    "Summit Point T1 Late Braking Flow - Automaticity Forming (Jan 21, NEW): Focused practice session on T1 late braking ('full brakes just after 3 cones'). DATA PROOF of muscle memory forming: (1) Brake application rate 170.4%/s (FASTEST on entire track = COMMITMENT), (2) Corner consistency σ 0.162s ('solid' rating = REPEATABLE), (3) Steering jerk 17.96 rad/s² (smooth considering limit-pushing). Master Lonn's feeling ('almost flow automatically to the apex') is validated. He's not just braking late ONCE - he's braking late CONSISTENTLY every lap with same technique. Neural pathways forming. T1 has 1,599 oversteer events (high) BUT low variance (σ 0.162s) = this is CONTROLLED oversteer from late braking, not uncontrolled technique error. Difference from T5: T5 oversteer was WASTEFUL (poor technique), T1 oversteer is PRODUCTIVE (limit-pushing). This is intelligent driving.",
    "The Redistribution Effect (Summit Point, Jan 21, NEW PRINCIPLE): Total oversteer events similar between baseline and focused practice (~6,378 vs ~6,103), but DISTRIBUTION changed dramatically. Baseline: T5 was 96% of all oversteer (6,103 at one corner). Today: T5 down to 2,479, T1 up to 1,599. WHY? Fixing T5 technique (eliminating WASTEFUL oversteer from trail braking) freed mental bandwidth to attack T1 harder (exploiting PRODUCTIVE oversteer from late braking). This is SMART DRIVING: (1) Eliminate technique-error oversteer, (2) Exploit limit-pushing oversteer. The data proves it's working: T1 has HIGH oversteer but LOW variance (controlled), T5 has REDUCED oversteer and IMPROVING variance (technique working). For guidebook: not all oversteer is bad - distinguish between wasteful (technique error) and productive (limit-finding).",
    "Focused Practice > Mindless Laps (Summit Point Jan 21, VALIDATION): 17-minute session, 2 focus areas (T1 late braking + T5 coasting), data-validated results on BOTH. T5: 59% oversteer reduction. T1: automaticity forming (σ 0.162s). Matched baseline PB (1:16.167 vs 1:16.150) without chasing times - just practicing technique. Compare to baseline (1 hour, all corners, scattered learning): MORE skill built in LESS time because: (1) Clear plan (T1 + T5 only), (2) Specific techniques (late braking marker, coasting method), (3) Repetition until automatic (11 flying laps). ADHD brain THRIVES on limited, clear objectives. Sequential Mastery framework working: one corner at a time, build foundations, move on. For sessions going forward: 15-20 min max, 2 focus areas max, specific technique goals, STOP when goals met (don't undo neural wiring by overtraining).",
    "T2 Summit Point - Smoothness Reference Corner (Jan 21, NEW): T2 is now DIALED: σ 0.044s (best corner on track), steering jerk 9.24 rad/s² (smoothest corner of lap). This is the TEMPLATE for what 'mastery' feels like at Summit Point. When other corners feel chaotic, remember T2 - the smooth, committed, repeatable feeling. Copy this to other corners. T2 serves same role as Champion Curve at Oran Park (reference standard). Neural pattern exists - now replicate it.",
    "Speed as Byproduct of Technique (Jan 21, RE-VALIDATION): Master Lonn matched baseline PB (1:16.167 vs 1:16.150) in a focused PRACTICE session with technique goals, not speed goals. He wasn't chasing lap times - just drilling T1 late braking and T5 coasting. The PB came anyway because: (1) Good technique removes wasted time, (2) Confidence from focused work allows natural limit-finding, (3) Flow state comes from process focus, not outcome focus. This re-validates Week 06 Oran Park lesson ('consistency-first produces speed'). For races: commit to technique execution, let speed come as byproduct. Don't force it.",
    "Summit Point Sequential Mastery Progress (Week 07, Updated Jan 21): Baseline (Jan 20): PB 1:16.150, T5 oversteer 6,103, T1 σ ~0.3s (estimated). Focused Practice (Jan 21): PB 1:16.167, T5 oversteer 2,479 (-59%), T1 σ 0.162s (-46% improvement). TWO corners addressed, both showing measurable improvement within 24 hours. T1 and T5 techniques are now FORMING muscle memory (not yet fully automatic, but on the path). Next session tonight: monitor T1+T5 automaticity (do they STAY consistent?), add ONE more corner (T3 Wagon Bend or T6 Carousel Exit), build the sequence. The framework is working: identify nemesis → isolate technique → drill to automatic → maintain while adding next corner. Ready to scale to full-lap mastery."
