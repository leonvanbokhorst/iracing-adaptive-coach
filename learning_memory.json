    "Brake Bias Protocol (Winton): Start 57.5% (stability on cold tires). Click down (2 clicks) to 56.5% after L3+ as tires warm up and rotation is needed. 56.5% is the floor.",
    "Vision Technique: 'Looking through the car' is the key to proximity. Focus on track, treat car ahead as peripheral obstacle. Enables flow state in traffic.",
    "Proximity Gap: 0.2s feels risky but is safer than 0.4s+ because it prevents 'gap panic' when leader brakes. Being closer means reacting to their car body language, not just brake lights.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: PROVEN. Giving up pace in L1-L3 (Survival Mode) allows for 'Alien Mode' in L4+ once tires/nerves settle. Resulted in P11 -> P1 drive.",
    "Quali Reality: Race pace (1:26.2) > Quali pace (1:26.8) is normal due to tire physics. Everyone is faster in race. The goal is not to match race pace, but to maximize cold tire grip relative to field.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
    "REALITY CHECK (Alien Pace): 1:25.7 is great, but 1:24.0 (Eric Wong) is the true Alien benchmark. 1.7s gap remains. 0.7s to just break into 1:24s.",
    "Efficiency Maxed (0.08s Gap): Gap to theoretical optimal is only 0.08s. This means the 'easy speed' is gone. Further gains require moving the limit (better line/technique), not just reducing errors.",
    "Fatigue & Precision: Fatigue degrades Technical Sectors (S1, S2) first. Flow Sectors (S3, S4) relying on muscle memory remain robust. When tired, 'Robot Mode' works in flow, but fails in precision.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Flow): In high-stress Top Split, 'going with the flow' (Meebewegen) rather than fighting for every inch yields better consistency (0.36s) and speed than aggression."
