    "Brake Bias Protocol (Winton): Start 57.5% (stability on cold tires). Click down (2 clicks) to 56.5% after L3+ as tires warm up and rotation is needed. 56.5% is the floor.",
    "Vision Technique: 'Looking through the car' is the key to proximity. Focus on track, treat car ahead as peripheral obstacle. Enables flow state in traffic.",
    "Proximity Gap: 0.2s feels risky but is safer than 0.4s+ because it prevents 'gap panic' when leader brakes. Being closer means reacting to their car body language, not just brake lights.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: PROVEN. Giving up pace in L1-L3 (Survival Mode) allows for 'Alien Mode' in L4+ once tires/nerves settle. Resulted in P11 -> P1 drive.",
    "Quali Paradox: Race pace (1:25.7) is faster than Quali pace (1:27.1). Indicates mental block/nerves in Quali. Need to bring 'Flow State' to the single lap.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
    "REALITY CHECK (Alien Pace): 1:25.7 is great, but 1:24.0 (Eric Wong) is the true Alien benchmark. 1.7s gap remains. 0.7s to just break into 1:24s."
