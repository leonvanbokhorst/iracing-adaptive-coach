  "insights": [
    "Brake Bias Protocol (Winton): Start 57.5% (stability on cold tires). Click down (2 clicks) to 56.5% after L3+ as tires warm up and rotation is needed. 56.5% is the floor.",
    "Vision Technique: 'Looking through the car' is the key to proximity. Focus on track, treat car ahead as peripheral obstacle. Enables flow state in traffic.",
    "Proximity Gap: 0.2s feels risky but is safer than 0.4s+ because it prevents 'gap panic' when leader brakes. Being closer means reacting to their car body language, not just brake lights.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: PROVEN. Giving up pace in L1-L3 (Survival Mode) allows for 'Alien Mode' in L4+ once tires/nerves settle. Resulted in P11 -> P1 drive.",
    "Quali Reality: Race pace (1:26.2) > Quali pace (1:26.8) is normal due to tire physics. Everyone is faster in race. The goal is not to match race pace, but to maximize cold tire grip relative to field.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
    "REALITY CHECK (Alien Pace): 1:25.7 is great, but 1:24.0 (Eric Wong) is the true Alien benchmark. 1.7s gap remains. 0.7s to just break into 1:24s.",
    "Efficiency Maxed (0.08s Gap): Gap to theoretical optimal is only 0.08s. This means the 'easy speed' is gone. Further gains require moving the limit (better line/technique), not just reducing errors.",
    "Fatigue & Precision: Fatigue degrades Technical Sectors (S1, S2) first. Flow Sectors (S3, S4) relying on muscle memory remain robust. When tired, 'Robot Mode' works in flow, but fails in precision.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Flow): In high-stress Top Split, 'going with the flow' (Meebewegen) rather than fighting for every inch yields better consistency (0.36s) and speed than aggression.",
    "Momentum Chaining (Lime Rock): On short tracks like Lime Rock, corners chain together. A poor T1 kills T2 which kills T3. One throttle commit, one brake, flow through. The track rewards rhythm over heroics.",
    "Compression Grip (T5 Uphill): Uphill transitions load front tires naturally. Panic-braking wastes this 'free grip'. Lift-only entry + early throttle commit = faster than heavy braking.",
    "S3 Variance Pattern: When S3 σ is 4-7x higher than other sectors, it's a bravery/consistency problem, not technique. The fast laps prove the skill exists - now make it repeatable.",
    "Chapter 16 (Spatial Awareness) VALIDATED: Edge Mapping Drill (Practice 03: slow edge-finding at 70% pace) → Race Pace Validation (Practice 04: normal session) resulted in 56% S3 consistency improvement (0.416s → 0.183s σ) AND new PB (56.238s). Proof: addressing spatial fear ('30cm buffer tax') directly improves both consistency and pace. Theory-to-practice cycle = 3 hours (chapter written morning, applied morning, validated afternoon).",
    "Negative Gap to Optimal (-0.011s): When best lap beats theoretical optimal (best sectors combined), it means momentum carry through sector boundaries is working. Not just hitting checkpoints—flowing through entire lap. This is 'lap-level' optimization vs 'sector-level' optimization.",
    "Telemetry Comparison (Gong vs Master Lonn - Lime Rock GP): 0.541s gap. Key findings: (1) T5 (uphill) is NOW FASTER (+1.87 km/h vs Gong) - Chapter 16 validated in competition context. (2) T1 is biggest loss zone (-13.94 km/h) tied to T9 exit speed. (3) Max lateral G: Gong 3.16G vs Master 2.28G (0.88G gap) = not at tire limit yet, room to push harder. (4) Brake authority: Gong uses 92.3% vs Master 75.8% - not using full brake potential. (5) Faster on 43% of lap (competitive), slower on 57% (concentrated in 3 zones: T1, T6/T7, straight).",
    "Cornering Grip Headroom: Max lateral G comparison reveals driver is using 2.28G when car is capable of 3.16G (Gong proves it). That's 0.88G (28%) of untapped cornering potential. This is technique-limited, not car-limited. Building confidence in higher cornering loads is the next frontier after consistency is locked in.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0 Win Streak (3/3 UPDATED): Winton AI Race (P11→P1), Lime Rock AI Race 1 (P5→P1), Lime Rock AI Race 2 (P6→P1). The contract works consistently: survive L1-L3 at 80-85% pace (let tires/nerves settle), then deploy race pace L4+ when field spreads. This strategy converts mid-pack starts into victories by avoiding early chaos and capitalizing on mistakes ahead. Proven across two different tracks and three consecutive victories.",
    "Exit Speed as Overtaking Weapon (Lime Rock T7): Better exit from The Diving Turn (T7) directly translated to slipstream passes on the main straight into T1. Driver quote: 'Faster exit out of the last corner, slip stream, bam.' This validates the Week 04 exit speed focus—it's not just lap time, it's racecraft. Exit advantage → drag reduction → clean pass. The physics work.",
    "Consistency Transfer to Pressure (Practice → Race): Practice σ 0.367s → Race σ ~0.43s. The consistency built in practice holds under race pressure (traffic, positioning, strategy). Only +0.06s degradation despite added variables. This proves the mental/technical foundation is solid. Repeatability isn't just hot-lapping—it's deployable in competition.",
    "Brake Authority Under Pressure: Practice max brake 75.8% → Race max brake 77.7%. Pressure situations (defending, attacking, traffic) unlock higher commitment levels than solo practice. This suggests the mental limiter (fear/caution) relaxes when focused on competition vs lap time. Race conditions can reveal true capability.",
    "Chapter 16 Race Validation: Spatial awareness confidence ('knowing where edges are') built in Practice 03 (edge mapping drill) held under race conditions. Driver self-assessment: 'Felt confident and smooth.' The work doesn't evaporate under pressure—it becomes the foundation for calm, fast racing. S2 (Esses) σ 0.096s in traffic proves precision holds even in tight sections with opponents nearby.",
    "Routine = Professional (NEW): Driver's post-race comment 'Felt more routine' is not diminishing praise. It's the opposite. It means the driver executed a proven system (Cold Tire Contract) without panic, drama, or overthinking. Indicates maturity in racecraft. Non-routine wins involve heroics. Routine wins involve repetition of proven strategy. Growth.",
    "Racecraft vs Raw Pace (NEW): Race 02 fastest lap 56.955s is 0.283s slower than practice PB 56.238s. The gap is entirely due to traffic/positioning/strategy, not loss of pace. This means racecraft (reading overtakes, positioning for passes, defending) is being deployed at the cost of raw lap time. This is correct in races. Validates that driver understands the difference between 'hot-lapping solo' and 'racing with others.'",
    "Meebewegen Validated by Contrast (Race 03): Driver ran deliberate aggression experiment. Results: 4 races with patience = 4 wins (P1, P1, P1, P1). 1 race with aggression = P2 + rear-ended. Driver self-diagnosis: 'Being strategic like a ninja is way more effective and calm.' The fastest lap (56.655s) came on Lap 11 AFTER chaos settled. Pace doesn't need aggression—it needs SPACE. This is now proven from both directions: patience works, aggression doesn't.",
    "S1 (Big Bend) as Conflict Zone: When racing aggressively, S1 variance exploded (0.607s vs S2's 0.186s). Big Bend is where passes happen at Lime Rock, and forcing the issue there costs rhythm and consistency. The aggression tax is paid in S1.",
    "Meebewegen Official Validation (NEW): First official Top Split race (SoF 2035) deployed 'let faster guy through' strategy. Result: P3 podium preserved, 0 incidents, +71 iRating. Fighting would have risked: incident, tire wear, mental drain, likely losing position anyway. Strategic patience pays dividends in real competition.",
    "Consistency Sharpens Under Pressure (NEW): Practice σ 0.37s → Official Race σ 0.20s. Master Lonn's consistency IMPROVES (by 46%) when stakes are real. This is the hallmark of a pressure performer. The race environment doesn't break focus—it enhances it.",
    "S3 Mastery Complete (NEW): The Uphill (T5) went from σ 1.07s (no clue how to take it) to σ 0.197s (locked in) over 6 sessions. Chapter 16 Edge Mapping + compression trust + throttle ramp sequencing = complete solution. T5 is no longer a weakness—it's a strength.",
    "Consistency Creates Traffic (NEW): Official Race 01 proved that being uncatchable (σ 0.197s) is more valuable than being fastest. P4 (Pears) had 0.25s more pace but got stuck behind P5 (Nakao) for half the race. Nakao couldn't catch Master Lonn, so he became a rolling roadblock. By the time Pears got clear, the gap was insurmountable. Consistency → Traffic jam behind → Position protected.",
    "GR86 Track Memory Transfer: Oschersleben baseline showed that previous car experience (GR86) provides layout familiarity, but input calibration must be redone for FF1600. Master Lonn found near-optimal pace (0.037s gap) within 8 laps because he knew WHERE the corners were—just had to learn HOW the new car handles them.",
    "Gong Comparison (Oschersleben): 2.4s gap to alien is NOT cornering ability—max lat G is identical (2.28 vs 2.27). Gap is deployment: brake 3.1% MORE of lap, full throttle 4.7% LESS, accel G 0.31 gentler. Hotel entry (braking 50m earlier) and Zeppelin (heavy braking) are biggest loss zones. Baseline = driving within limits. Now we know where the time lives.",
    "VRS T1-T2 Hotel Technique (Johnny Gideon 1:31.295): TURN FIRST, BRAKE SECOND. The key insight: 'It's not about how MUCH you slow down, it's about HOW you get to minimum speed. Slow gradually = optimal. Quick decel = losing lap time.' The Hotel is the LONGEST braking zone of the lap (5-6 seconds). Technique: (1) Turn 2-3 car lengths before access road, (2) Initial brake 25-30% only, (3) Release to ~10% through kink, (4) Stay in 4th gear through T1 (no downshifts!), (5) Reserve bulk of braking for straighter section between T1-T2, (6) Overlap throttle with brakes during downshifts to stabilize rear, (7) Downshift to 1st by T2 apex. Master Lonn's error: doing too much braking too early, killing speed before the kink."

  "next_steps": [
    "STRATEGY VALIDATED IN OFFICIAL RACE: Official Race 01 (SoF 2035, P3 finish) proved Meebewegen works against real competition. Let faster guy through → preserved podium with 0 incidents. Patience > ego.",
    "Race Strategy TRIPLE-VALIDATED: Cold Tire Contract + Meebewegen now proven in AI races (5 wins) AND official Top Split race (P3 podium). The system is bulletproof across competition types.",
    "Consistency Under Pressure PROVEN: Practice σ 0.37s → Race σ 0.20s. Master Lonn gets MORE consistent when it matters. Pressure performer confirmed.",
    "S3 (The Uphill) SOLVED: σ went from 1.07s (Week 04 Session 3) to 0.197s (Official Race 01). 82% improvement. Chapter 16 Edge Mapping + 'trust the compression' is now race-validated.",
    "New Focus - S1 (Big Bend): With S3 locked in, S1 is now the highest loss/lap sector (0.207s). Single brake input + maintenance throttle = next optimization target.",
