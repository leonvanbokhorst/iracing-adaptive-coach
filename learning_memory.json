    "Brake Bias Protocol (Winton): Start 57.5% (stability on cold tires). Click down (2 clicks) to 56.5% after L3+ as tires warm up and rotation is needed. 56.5% is the floor.",
    "Vision Technique: 'Looking through the car' is the key to proximity. Focus on track, treat car ahead as peripheral obstacle. Enables flow state in traffic.",
    "Proximity Gap: 0.2s feels risky but is safer than 0.4s+ because it prevents 'gap panic' when leader brakes. Being closer means reacting to their car body language, not just brake lights.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: PROVEN. Giving up pace in L1-L3 (Survival Mode) allows for 'Alien Mode' in L4+ once tires/nerves settle. Resulted in P11 -> P1 drive.",
    "Quali Reality: Race pace (1:26.2) > Quali pace (1:26.8) is normal due to tire physics. Everyone is faster in race. The goal is not to match race pace, but to maximize cold tire grip relative to field.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
    "REALITY CHECK (Alien Pace): 1:25.7 is great, but 1:24.0 (Eric Wong) is the true Alien benchmark. 1.7s gap remains. 0.7s to just break into 1:24s.",
    "Efficiency Maxed (0.08s Gap): Gap to theoretical optimal is only 0.08s. This means the 'easy speed' is gone. Further gains require moving the limit (better line/technique), not just reducing errors.",
    "Fatigue & Precision: Fatigue degrades Technical Sectors (S1, S2) first. Flow Sectors (S3, S4) relying on muscle memory remain robust. When tired, 'Robot Mode' works in flow, but fails in precision.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Flow): In high-stress Top Split, 'going with the flow' (Meebewegen) rather than fighting for every inch yields better consistency (0.36s) and speed than aggression.",
    "Momentum Chaining (Lime Rock): On short tracks like Lime Rock, corners chain together. A poor T1 kills T2 which kills T3. One throttle commit, one brake, flow through. The track rewards rhythm over heroics.",
    "Compression Grip (T5 Uphill): Uphill transitions load front tires naturally. Panic-braking wastes this 'free grip'. Lift-only entry + early throttle commit = faster than heavy braking.",
    "S3 Variance Pattern: When S3 σ is 4-7x higher than other sectors, it's a bravery/consistency problem, not technique. The fast laps prove the skill exists - now make it repeatable.",
    "Chapter 16 (Spatial Awareness) VALIDATED: Edge Mapping Drill (Practice 03: slow edge-finding at 70% pace) → Race Pace Validation (Practice 04: normal session) resulted in 56% S3 consistency improvement (0.416s → 0.183s σ) AND new PB (56.238s). Proof: addressing spatial fear ('30cm buffer tax') directly improves both consistency and pace. Theory-to-practice cycle = 3 hours (chapter written morning, applied morning, validated afternoon).",
    "Negative Gap to Optimal (-0.011s): When best lap beats theoretical optimal (best sectors combined), it means momentum carry through sector boundaries is working. Not just hitting checkpoints—flowing through entire lap. This is 'lap-level' optimization vs 'sector-level' optimization.",
    "Telemetry Comparison (Gong vs Master Lonn - Lime Rock GP): 0.541s gap. Key findings: (1) T5 (uphill) is NOW FASTER (+1.87 km/h vs Gong) - Chapter 16 validated in competition context. (2) T1 is biggest loss zone (-13.94 km/h) tied to T9 exit speed. (3) Max lateral G: Gong 3.16G vs Master 2.28G (0.88G gap) = not at tire limit yet, room to push harder. (4) Brake authority: Gong uses 92.3% vs Master 75.8% - not using full brake potential. (5) Faster on 43% of lap (competitive), slower on 57% (concentrated in 3 zones: T1, T6/T7, straight).",
    "Cornering Grip Headroom: Max lateral G comparison reveals driver is using 2.28G when car is capable of 3.16G (Gong proves it). That's 0.88G (28%) of untapped cornering potential. This is technique-limited, not car-limited. Building confidence in higher cornering loads is the next frontier after consistency is locked in.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0 Win Streak (3/3 UPDATED): Winton AI Race (P11→P1), Lime Rock AI Race 1 (P5→P1), Lime Rock AI Race 2 (P6→P1). The contract works consistently: survive L1-L3 at 80-85% pace (let tires/nerves settle), then deploy race pace L4+ when field spreads. This strategy converts mid-pack starts into victories by avoiding early chaos and capitalizing on mistakes ahead. Proven across two different tracks and three consecutive victories.",
    "Exit Speed as Overtaking Weapon (Lime Rock T7): Better exit from The Diving Turn (T7) directly translated to slipstream passes on the main straight into T1. Driver quote: 'Faster exit out of the last corner, slip stream, bam.' This validates the Week 04 exit speed focus—it's not just lap time, it's racecraft. Exit advantage → drag reduction → clean pass. The physics work.",
    "Consistency Transfer to Pressure (Practice → Race): Practice σ 0.367s → Race σ ~0.43s. The consistency built in practice holds under race pressure (traffic, positioning, strategy). Only +0.06s degradation despite added variables. This proves the mental/technical foundation is solid. Repeatability isn't just hot-lapping—it's deployable in competition.",
    "Brake Authority Under Pressure: Practice max brake 75.8% → Race max brake 77.7%. Pressure situations (defending, attacking, traffic) unlock higher commitment levels than solo practice. This suggests the mental limiter (fear/caution) relaxes when focused on competition vs lap time. Race conditions can reveal true capability.",
    "Chapter 16 Race Validation: Spatial awareness confidence ('knowing where edges are') built in Practice 03 (edge mapping drill) held under race conditions. Driver self-assessment: 'Felt confident and smooth.' The work doesn't evaporate under pressure—it becomes the foundation for calm, fast racing. S2 (Esses) σ 0.096s in traffic proves precision holds even in tight sections with opponents nearby.",
    "Routine = Professional (NEW): Driver's post-race comment 'Felt more routine' is not diminishing praise. It's the opposite. It means the driver executed a proven system (Cold Tire Contract) without panic, drama, or overthinking. Indicates maturity in racecraft. Non-routine wins involve heroics. Routine wins involve repetition of proven strategy. Growth.",
    "Racecraft vs Raw Pace (NEW): Race 02 fastest lap 56.955s is 0.283s slower than practice PB 56.238s. The gap is entirely due to traffic/positioning/strategy, not loss of pace. This means racecraft (reading overtakes, positioning for passes, defending) is being deployed at the cost of raw lap time. This is correct in races. Validates that driver understands the difference between 'hot-lapping solo' and 'racing with others.'",
    "Meebewegen Validated by Contrast (Race 03): Driver ran deliberate aggression experiment. Results: 4 races with patience = 4 wins (P1, P1, P1, P1). 1 race with aggression = P2 + rear-ended. Driver self-diagnosis: 'Being strategic like a ninja is way more effective and calm.' The fastest lap (56.655s) came on Lap 11 AFTER chaos settled. Pace doesn't need aggression—it needs SPACE. This is now proven from both directions: patience works, aggression doesn't.",
    "S1 (Big Bend) as Conflict Zone: When racing aggressively, S1 variance exploded (0.607s vs S2's 0.186s). Big Bend is where passes happen at Lime Rock, and forcing the issue there costs rhythm and consistency. The aggression tax is paid in S1.",
    "Meebewegen Official Validation (NEW): First official Top Split race (SoF 2035) deployed 'let faster guy through' strategy. Result: P3 podium preserved, 0 incidents, +71 iRating. Fighting would have risked: incident, tire wear, mental drain, likely losing position anyway. Strategic patience pays dividends in real competition.",
    "Consistency Sharpens Under Pressure (NEW): Practice σ 0.37s → Official Race σ 0.20s. Master Lonn's consistency IMPROVES (by 46%) when stakes are real. This is the hallmark of a pressure performer. The race environment doesn't break focus—it enhances it.",
    "S3 Mastery Complete (NEW): The Uphill (T5) went from σ 1.07s (no clue how to take it) to σ 0.197s (locked in) over 6 sessions. Chapter 16 Edge Mapping + compression trust + throttle ramp sequencing = complete solution. T5 is no longer a weakness—it's a strength.",
    "Consistency Creates Traffic (NEW): Official Race 01 proved that being uncatchable (σ 0.197s) is more valuable than being fastest. P4 (Pears) had 0.25s more pace but got stuck behind P5 (Nakao) for half the race. Nakao couldn't catch Master Lonn, so he became a rolling roadblock. By the time Pears got clear, the gap was insurmountable. Consistency → Traffic jam behind → Position protected.",
    "GR86 Track Memory Transfer: Oschersleben baseline showed that previous car experience (GR86) provides layout familiarity, but input calibration must be redone for FF1600. Master Lonn found near-optimal pace (0.037s gap) within 8 laps because he knew WHERE the corners were—just had to learn HOW the new car handles them.",
    "Gong Comparison (Oschersleben): 2.4s gap to alien is NOT cornering ability—max lat G is identical (2.28 vs 2.27). Gap is deployment: brake 3.1% MORE of lap, full throttle 4.7% LESS, accel G 0.31 gentler. Hotel entry (braking 50m earlier) and Zeppelin (heavy braking) are biggest loss zones. Baseline = driving within limits. Now we know where the time lives.",
    "VRS T1-T2 Hotel Technique (Johnny Gideon 1:31.295): TURN FIRST, BRAKE SECOND. The key insight: 'It's not about how MUCH you slow down, it's about HOW you get to minimum speed. Slow gradually = optimal. Quick decel = losing lap time.' The Hotel is the LONGEST braking zone of the lap (5-6 seconds). Technique: (1) Turn 2-3 car lengths before access road, (2) Initial brake 25-30% only, (3) Release to ~10% through kink, (4) Stay in 4th gear through T1 (no downshifts!), (5) Reserve bulk of braking for straighter section between T1-T2, (6) Overlap throttle with brakes during downshifts to stabilize rear, (7) Downshift to 1st by T2 apex. Master Lonn's error: doing too much braking too early, killing speed before the kink.",
    "IBT Session Learning Curve (NEW): Practice 02 showed visible learning progression within single session. L1-L6 avg at problem corner (T2): 9.76s with 3 incidents. L7-L16 avg at same corner: 7.45s with 0 incidents. That's 2.3s improvement at ONE corner through self-correction. Last 6 laps (L11-L16) averaged 1:33.55s with ~0.18s σ. The data proves: early chaos ≠ session failure. Patience + laps = learning.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit Nemesis Pattern (NEW): T2 is objectively difficult: (1) Entry partially blind (cresting), (2) Decreasing radius (tightens), (3) Downhill (less rear grip), (4) Still recovering from T1 chaos. GR86 muscle memory interferes—knows WHERE to turn but not HOW in FF1600. σ = 2.257s across 16 laps. When T2 works, lap is 1:33.x. When T2 fails, lap is 1:40+. The difference between good and disaster lap lives at T2.",
    "Consistency-First Produces Speed (NEW): Practice 03 goal was ONLY consistency ('hit same marks ten times'). Result: PB anyway (1:33.167), zero incidents, T2 variance dropped 90%. Focusing on repeatability paradoxically unlocks speed because: (1) removes fear/tension, (2) builds confidence, (3) allows natural limit-finding without panic. Speed is a byproduct of consistency, not the goal itself.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit Progression: Fear → Shaky → Solid → Dialed. Practice 02: σ 2.257s (lottery/fear). Practice 03: σ 0.219s (solid/shaky). Next target: σ < 0.15s (approaching dialed). The pattern shows corner mastery is a gradual process—don't expect 'dialed' immediately after 'lottery'.",
    "Self-Correction Within Session (NEW): Practice 03 Lap 4 had worst T2 (8.15s). Laps 5-10 immediately recovered (7.42-7.58s range). Driver self-corrected without external coaching input. This indicates internalized feedback loop—feel → adjust → verify. Sign of developing driver maturity.",
    "IBT-Only Workflow Validated (NEW): Practice 03 was analyzed entirely from IBT file—no G61 CSV exports needed. Session extraction tool provides lap times, sector times, corner times, and consistency metrics. Now includes automatic OUTLAP DETECTION (excludes Lap 1 if >1.5s slower than median). IBT technique analysis adds oversteer patterns, tire temps, weight transfer. G61 exports are now optional/backup, not required.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit MASTERED (Race Validated): σ progression: 2.257s (lottery) → 0.219s (shaky) → 0.066s (DIALED). 97% improvement over 3 sessions. Corner mastered UNDER RACE PRESSURE—not just in practice. The consistency-first approach (Practice 03) paid off when stakes were real.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0 Win Streak (6/7 UPDATED): Winton AI (P11→P1), Lime Rock AI x3 (P5→P1, P6→P1, P2*), Oschersleben AI x2 (P6→P1, P1). *P2 was deliberate aggression test. Pattern: survive L1-L3 at 80-85%, attack L4+ when field spreads. Now proven at 3 different tracks. The contract is not track-specific—it's a universal race strategy.",
    "Oschersleben Overtaking Strategy: Main straight into T1-T2 is THE spot. Requirements: (1) Clean T14 Zeppelin exit, (2) Slipstream on Stadiongerade, (3) Late brake into Hotel complex. Limited overtaking options = patience required. This track rewards chess, not checkers.",
    "Final Lap Performance Pattern: AI Race 01 fastest lap was Lap 8 (final lap). Race pace IMPROVED throughout as tires came in and traffic cleared. This indicates: (1) Good tire management (not overheating early), (2) Mental composure under pressure, (3) Understanding that fastest laps come when you stop fighting and start flowing.",
    "Overnight Corner Processing (NEW): T12 Amman Kurve went from σ 0.276s (only flagged corner in Race 01) to σ 0.069s (dialed) in Race 02 with NO explicit practice between sessions. The brain processes and consolidates corner technique during sleep. Don't underestimate 'doing nothing' as part of the learning process. Reps + Rest = Mastery.",
    "Track Mastery Achieved (Oschersleben): AI Race 02 showed 14/14 corners DIALED (σ < 0.10s). First track in Season 01 with complete corner mastery. Progression: Day 1 = 2 corners dialed. Day 4 = 14/14 dialed. The 'consistency-first' approach (Practice 03) unlocked this by removing fear and allowing natural limit-finding.",
    "Low-Stakes Races as Test Sessions (NEW): AI Race 02 competition was weak initially, but required 4 laps of defensive driving (L5-L8). Master Lonn deployed center line defense (first time ever) and set PB (1:32.933) on Lap 7 WHILE defending. This disproves 'PBs need relaxed mind' — pace can come from competitive pressure too.",
    "Center Line Defense (NEW TECHNIQUE): First time Master Lonn used deliberate defensive positioning. Technique: Take center line on straights/approaches, denying clean overtake on both inside AND outside. Forces attacker to commit to a side, allows defender to react. Result: Held P1 for 4 laps against pressure, 0 incidents, PB mid-defense. This is a sustainable defense strategy (vs blocking which loses speed).",
    "PB Under Defensive Pressure (NEW): AI Race 02 Lap 7 PB (1:32.933) came while defending position, not in clear air. This contradicts assumption that best pace requires 'relaxed mind.' The competitive pressure (someone on your tail) can sharpen focus and extract pace. Defending ≠ slowing down. Defending WITH pace = elite racecraft.",
    "Lift-on-Steer Pattern (NEW): IBT analysis revealed 'throttle lift when adding steering' pattern — classic commitment issue. T9 Chicane Exit was worst offender (23%). Cause: brain says 'rotation = danger' so foot instinctively lifts. Irony: the lift CAUSES instability (weight transfer forward, light rear). Fix: pick throttle %, HOLD through steering input. 8 laps of focused practice reduced T9 from 23% → 17%. T7 Hairpin went from 10.4% → 0.5% (fully rewired). Pattern can be broken with conscious effort.",
    "Focused Drill Methodology (NEW): Short practice sessions (8-10 laps) with ONE specific focus are more effective than long 'try to be faster' sessions. Smooth Input Drill: focus on throttle commitment, not lap times. Result: nearly matched PB anyway + measurable technique improvement. For ADHD brain, small focused bites > long unfocused sessions.",
    "FFB Tuning (MAIRA 35% → 30%): Reducing FFB strength by 5% resulted in 13% smoother steering overall, up to 29% smoother in tight corners (chicane). Jerk σ dropped from 17.25 to 15.44. Consistency IMPROVED (σ 0.70s → 0.515s) and pace held (nearly matched PB). Strong FFB causes micro-corrections that show up as steering jerk. Less fighting the wheel = more flow. 30% MAIRA strength is the new baseline for FF1600.",
    "Smooth Input Transfer (Practice → Race): AI Race 03 proved that conscious smooth input practice transfers to race conditions. Steering jerk: Practice 11.3 rad/s² → Race 11.43 rad/s² (only 1.2% increase under race pressure). This confirms neural rewiring is happening—the smooth inputs aren't just temporary focus, they're becoming habit. The FFB reduction + focused drill + race deployment = validated workflow for technique changes.",
    "S2 Elite Consistency Under Pressure: AI Race 03 showed S2 σ = 0.103s (100 milliseconds variance) across 7 flying laps IN A RACE. This is professional-level consistency in the technical middle sector. Proves that when technique is dialed, it holds under traffic and pressure.",
    "Yield to Faster Cars (Meebewegen 2.0): AI Race 03 taught the hard way: if someone is genuinely faster, let them go. P2 > P10 + broken ego. Master Lonn's reflection: 'He was faster... when he made the move I should have let him go.' This extends Meebewegen from 'let faster guys through early' to 'yield when defending costs more than it gains.' Defending a position you can't hold = gambling. P2 is not losing—it's maximizing the realistic outcome."
