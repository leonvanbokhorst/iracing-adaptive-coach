    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
    "REALITY CHECK (Alien Pace): 1:25.7 is great, but 1:24.0 (Eric Wong) is the true Alien benchmark. 1.7s gap remains. 0.7s to just break into 1:24s.",
    "Efficiency Maxed (0.08s Gap): Gap to theoretical optimal is only 0.08s. This means the 'easy speed' is gone. Further gains require moving the limit (better line/technique), not just reducing errors.",
    "Fatigue & Precision: Fatigue degrades Technical Sectors (S1, S2) first. Flow Sectors (S3, S4) relying on muscle memory remain robust. When tired, 'Robot Mode' works in flow, but fails in precision.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Flow): In high-stress Top Split, 'going with the flow' (Meebewegen) rather than fighting for every inch yields better consistency (0.36s) and speed than aggression.",
    "Momentum Chaining (Lime Rock): On short tracks like Lime Rock, corners chain together. A poor T1 kills T2 which kills T3. One throttle commit, one brake, flow through. The track rewards rhythm over heroics.",
    "Compression Grip (T5 Uphill): Uphill transitions load front tires naturally. Panic-braking wastes this 'free grip'. Lift-only entry + early throttle commit = faster than heavy braking.",

    "Chapter 16 (Spatial Awareness) VALIDATED: Edge Mapping Drill (Practice 03: slow edge-finding at 70% pace) → Race Pace Validation (Practice 04: normal session) resulted in 56% S3 consistency improvement (0.416s → 0.183s σ) AND new PB (56.238s). Proof: addressing spatial fear ('30cm buffer tax') directly improves both consistency and pace. Theory-to-practice cycle = 3 hours (chapter written morning, applied morning, validated afternoon).",

(2) T1 is biggest loss zone (-13.94 km/h) tied to T9 exit speed. (3) Max lateral G: Gong 3.16G vs Master 2.28G (0.88G gap) = not at tire limit yet, room to push harder. (4) Brake authority: Gong uses 92.3% vs Master 75.8% - not using full brake potential. (5) Faster on 43% of lap (competitive), slower on 57% (concentrated in 3 zones: T1, T6/T7, straight).",

This is technique-limited, not car-limited. Building confidence in higher cornering loads is the next frontier after consistency is locked in.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0 Win Streak (2/2): Winton AI Race (P11→P1), Lime Rock AI Race (P5→P1). The contract works consistently: survive L1-L3 at 80-85% pace (let tires/nerves settle), then deploy race pace L4+ when field spreads. This strategy converts mid-pack starts into victories by avoiding early chaos and capitalizing on mistakes ahead. Proven across two different tracks.",
    "Exit Speed as Overtaking Weapon (Lime Rock T7): Better exit from The Diving Turn (T7) directly translated to slipstream passes on the main straight into T1. Driver quote: 'Faster exit out of the last corner, slip stream, bam.' This validates the Week 04 exit speed focus—it's not just lap time, it's racecraft. Exit advantage → drag reduction → clean pass. The physics work.",
    "Consistency Transfer to Pressure (Practice → Race): Practice σ 0.367s → Race σ ~0.43s. The consistency built in practice holds under race pressure (traffic, positioning, strategy). Only +0.06s degradation despite added variables. This proves the mental/technical foundation is solid. Repeatability isn't just hot-lapping—it's deployable in competition.",
    "Brake Authority Under Pressure: Practice max brake 75.8% → Race max brake 77.7%. Pressure situations (defending, attacking, traffic) unlock higher commitment levels than solo practice. This suggests the mental limiter (fear/caution) relaxes when focused on competition vs lap time. Race conditions can reveal true capability.",
    "Chapter 16 Race Validation: Spatial awareness confidence ('knowing where edges are') built in Practice 03 (edge mapping drill) held under race conditions. Driver self-assessment: 'Felt confident and smooth.' The work doesn't evaporate under pressure—it becomes the foundation for calm, fast racing. S2 (Esses) σ 0.096s in traffic proves precision holds even in tight sections with opponents nearby."

    "Post-First-Race Analysis COMPLETE: ✅ Consistency transfers (0.37s practice → 0.43s race). ✅ Exit speed = overtaking tool (T7→slipstream→pass). ✅ Chapter 16 confidence holds under pressure. ✅ Cold Tire Contract works (P5→P1 clean). Continue racing to build sample size.",
    "Gong Gap Closure (DEFERRED until Week 05+): 0.541s gap identified. Priorities logged (T1 entry, T6/T7 chain, lateral G building, brake authority). Week 04 mission: race wins > lap time hunting. Apply these improvements at next track with Chapter 16 drill early.",
    "Next Track Prep (Week 05): Apply Chapter 16 Edge Mapping Drill day 1 of new track (proven 3-hour theory-to-breakthrough cycle). Use T7 exit speed lesson: identify which corner exits onto longest straight = overtaking weapon zone. Deploy Cold Tire Contract from Race 1.",

Created full chapter codifying the 'Edge Mapping Drill' (3-phase: exit edges, entry edges, comparison). Principle: aliens aren't braver—they just have confident spatial maps of where the track edges are. Drill builds that map through deliberate, repeatable edge-touching at slow pace, then validates at race pace. Addresses 'fear tax' buffer and connects to exit speed + consistency improvements.",
      "evidence": "Driver statement: 'I seem to leave at least 30cm room compared to my VRS coach... I don't think I really know where the edge is when I'm in the car. Too cautious.' Connected to T5 exit consistency problem (not just throttle, but also not letting car run to full width).
