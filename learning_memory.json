    "Brake Bias Protocol (Winton): Start 57.5% (stability on cold tires). Click down (2 clicks) to 56.5% after L3+ as tires warm up and rotation is needed. 56.5% is the floor.",
    "Vision Technique: 'Looking through the car' is the key to proximity. Focus on track, treat car ahead as peripheral obstacle. Enables flow state in traffic.",
    "Proximity Gap: 0.2s feels risky but is safer than 0.4s+ because it prevents 'gap panic' when leader brakes. Being closer means reacting to their car body language, not just brake lights.",
    "Shadow Protocol Result: Master Lonn can follow (R3) and recover from contact (R4). 0.26s consistency AFTER being punted shows mental resilience.",
    "Braking in Traffic: 'Punted from back' suggests braking too early for the pack pace. Must brake 'with' the train, not 'before' it to be safe.",
    "DATA CORRECTION (Dec 28): AI Races analysis revised - 'Pressure = Focus' theory was INCORRECT. Pressure led to 5 incidents (errors). Consistency (0.39s) was due to driving alone in last place (free air).",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: Laps 1-2 are SURVIVAL. 30-90 seconds of impulse control determines the race. No passing attempts on cold tires.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Race Pace Transfer: Practice pace transfers to Race pace almost 1:1 (0.1s gap) - speed is not the issue, race start cleanliness is.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy."
