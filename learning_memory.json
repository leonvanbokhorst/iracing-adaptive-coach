Exit: work-needed → DIALED. Apex Exit precision: 0.2m σ (LASER). Gap to optimal: only 0.217s (AT the limit!). 8/12 corners DIALED. Full throttle usage up 8.7% (58.8%). BUT: 2 massive offs at Foster's Dip (Laps 8 & 9) during limit-finding. Lap 8 Exit: 8.15s corner (vs 2.033s best) = catastrophic gravel trip. Lap 9 Entry: 0.2 km/h (basically stopped). NEW PROBLEM: Coca-Cola Corner brake drift (45.6m σ, was solid in P01). Overall consistency worsened (2.064s σ) due to pushing hard for PB pace.

CORNERS CONNECTING VALIDATED: Master Lonn was RIGHT - 'more consistent' (9/12 corners solid+, 4/5 sectors sub-0.25s σ) AND 'surprising spins' (4 offs at lottery corners). S1, S2, S4, S5 all sub-0.25s σ = FLOW emerging through sequences. Champion Curve MAINTAINED (0.052s Entry, 0.142s Exit = still MASTERED). Steering smoothness IMPROVED (15.62 → 14.5 rad/s²) despite pushing harder. Coca-Cola brake σ improved (45.6m → 36.2m). Full throttle up (59.3%). BUT: Foster's Dip Entry = CHAOS (0.962s σ, 18.5m apex wander, Lap 14-15 back-to-back offs). SURPRISE DISCOVERY: Yokohama Bridge = HIDDEN LOTTERY (0.413s σ, 54.7m apex wander!, Lap 7 off). Both Yokohama + Foster's Dip are blind high-speed entries with elevation changes. Gap to optimal: 0.533s (basically AT limit). The time is ALL in Foster's + Yokohama (~0.45-0.7s addressable). This is textbook limit-finding: set PB, have offs at the 2 lottery corners, discover exactly where remaining speed lives. 75% of track (9/12 corners) now consistent. The track is becoming a sequence, not isolated corners. FOSTER'S DIP BREAKTHROUGH (END OF SESSION!): Master Lonn discovered the technique: 'Very light on brakes before the curbs on the left turning in. Don't even think about touching the curbs on the left, guaranteed spin.' DATA VALIDATED: Best Foster's Entry times (3.183s, 3.183s, 3.200s) ALL came on Laps 12, 17, 22 - AFTER discovery. Post-disaster (Lap 14 catastrophic off 7.867s), he REPEATED best time on Lap 17 (3.183s). This is learned technique, not luck. The technique (light brakes + early turn-in + trust compression + avoid left curbs) matches physics: 3.3G compression = free front grip, so heavy braking overloads fronts. Setup: BB 56% (was 55% in P02) gave 'more stable in the beginning' feeling - more front brake bias = sharper turn-in bite + stable rear. G61: 01KF5RFKEJ5SFFWQFFYE8QHWD9."

      "notes": "WEEK 06 SESSION 4 - PRE-RACE FINAL! NEW PERSONAL BEST: 1:11.033 (0.167s improvement over Practice 03). FOUR CONSECUTIVE PBs across four sessions (1.55s total improvement in 3 days!). Master Lonn's vibe check: 'Felt even more consistent and two or three surprising snaps, but I feel more and more in control.' DATA VALIDATES HIS FEELING: 10/12 corners DIALED (83% of track!), gap to optimal only 0.25s, Foster's Dip technique from P03 is now MUSCLE MEMORY (Entry 0.06s σ, Exit 0.042s σ with 0.2m apex precision!). Week 06 goals: ALL THREE ACHIEVED ✅✅✅ (Foster's Entry apex 13.8m, Exit speed variance 4.06 km/h, Coca-Cola corner σ 0.093s = all at or better than targets). Master Lonn was RIGHT about 'two or three snaps': ONE big off at Champion Exit Lap 10 (12.883s corner vs 2.1s avg = gravel trip), ONE Yokohama wobble Lap 11. Champion Exit off was pushing for PB (Entry too aggressive, carried too much speed into Exit). Yokohama Bridge remains the ONLY problem corner (71.6m apex wander, 26.86 rad/s² steering jerk = sawing at wheel). Diagnosis: treating Yokohama like a corner when it's a KINK (blind entry, high speed, no reference). Fix: pick EXIT marker, point and commit, calm hands, one smooth input. Brake consistency ELITE on 6 corners (< 6m σ: Shell, Champion Entry, Foster's Entry, Momo, O'Brien, Recaro). Foster's Dip is now a WEAPON (P03 discovery → P04 muscle memory → ready to attack here in races). Steering smoothness regressed slightly (16.1 vs 14.5 in P03) but NOT a concern (still smooth, just pushing for PB pace). Gap to Gong: closed from 2.7s (P01) to 1.2s (P04) = 1.5s improvement! Ready for AI races tomorrow. The work is done. Now it's about DEPLOYMENT (consistency > speed, avoid big mistakes, use Foster's as overtaking weapon). G61: 01KF62KQ4E5EVXZK8J7E3FKTWW."

(2) T1 is biggest loss zone (-13.94 km/h) tied to T9 exit speed. (3) Max lateral G: Gong 3.16G vs Master 2.28G (0.88G gap) = not at tire limit yet, room to push harder. (4) Brake authority: Gong uses 92.3% vs Master 75.8% - not using full brake potential. (5) Faster on 43% of lap (competitive), slower on 57% (concentrated in 3 zones: T1, T6/T7, straight).",

Routine wins involve repetition of proven strategy. Growth.",
    "Racecraft vs Raw Pace (NEW): Race 02 fastest lap 56.955s is 0.283s slower than practice PB 56.238s. The gap is entirely due to traffic/positioning/strategy, not loss of pace.

    "S3 Mastery Complete (NEW): The Uphill (T5) went from σ 1.07s (no clue how to take it) to σ 0.197s (locked in) over 6 sessions. Chapter 16 Edge Mapping + compression trust + throttle ramp sequencing = complete solution. T5 is no longer a weakness—it's a strength.",
    "Consistency Creates Traffic (NEW): Official Race 01 proved that being uncatchable (σ 0.197s) is more valuable than being fastest. P4 (Pears) had 0.25s more pace but got stuck behind P5 (Nakao) for half the race. Nakao couldn't catch Master Lonn, so he became a rolling roadblock. By the time Pears got clear, the gap was insurmountable. Consistency → Traffic jam behind → Position protected.",
    "GR86 Track Memory Transfer: Oschersleben baseline showed that previous car experience (GR86) provides layout familiarity, but input calibration must be redone for FF1600. Master Lonn found near-optimal pace (0.037s gap) within 8 laps because he knew WHERE the corners were—just had to learn HOW the new car handles them.",
    "Gong Comparison (Oschersleben): 2.4s gap to alien is NOT cornering ability—max lat G is identical (2.28 vs 2.27). Gap is deployment: brake 3.1% MORE of lap, full throttle 4.7% LESS, accel G 0.31 gentler. Hotel entry (braking 50m earlier) and Zeppelin (heavy braking) are biggest loss zones. Baseline = driving within limits. Now we know where the time lives.",
    "VRS T1-T2 Hotel Technique (Johnny Gideon 1:31.295): TURN FIRST, BRAKE SECOND. The key insight: 'It's not about how MUCH you slow down, it's about HOW you get to minimum speed. Slow gradually = optimal. Quick decel = losing lap time.' The Hotel is the LONGEST braking zone of the lap (5-6 seconds). Technique: (1) Turn 2-3 car lengths before access road, (2) Initial brake 25-30% only, (3) Release to ~10% through kink, (4) Stay in 4th gear through T1 (no downshifts!), (5) Reserve bulk of braking for straighter section between T1-T2, (6) Overlap throttle with brakes during downshifts to stabilize rear, (7) Downshift to 1st by T2 apex. Master Lonn's error: doing too much braking too early, killing speed before the kink.",
    "IBT Session Learning Curve (NEW): Practice 02 showed visible learning progression within single session. L1-L6 avg at problem corner (T2): 9.76s with 3 incidents. L7-L16 avg at same corner: 7.45s with 0 incidents. That's 2.3s improvement at ONE corner through self-correction. Last 6 laps (L11-L16) averaged 1:33.55s with ~0.18s σ. The data proves: early chaos ≠ session failure. Patience + laps = learning.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit Nemesis Pattern (NEW): T2 is objectively difficult: (1) Entry partially blind (cresting), (2) Decreasing radius (tightens), (3) Downhill (less rear grip), (4) Still recovering from T1 chaos. GR86 muscle memory interferes—knows WHERE to turn but not HOW in FF1600. σ = 2.257s across 16 laps. When T2 works, lap is 1:33.x. When T2 fails, lap is 1:40+. The difference between good and disaster lap lives at T2.",
    "Consistency-First Produces Speed (NEW): Practice 03 goal was ONLY consistency ('hit same marks ten times'). Result: PB anyway (1:33.167), zero incidents, T2 variance dropped 90%. Focusing on repeatability paradoxically unlocks speed because: (1) removes fear/tension, (2) builds confidence, (3) allows natural limit-finding without panic. Speed is a byproduct of consistency, not the goal itself.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit Progression: Fear → Shaky → Solid → Dialed. Practice 02: σ 2.257s (lottery/fear). Practice 03: σ 0.219s (solid/shaky). Next target: σ < 0.15s (approaching dialed). The pattern shows corner mastery is a gradual process—don't expect 'dialed' immediately after 'lottery'.",
    "Self-Correction Within Session (NEW): Practice 03 Lap 4 had worst T2 (8.15s). Laps 5-10 immediately recovered (7.42-7.58s range). Driver self-corrected without external coaching input. This indicates internalized feedback loop—feel → adjust → verify. Sign of developing driver maturity.",
    "IBT-Only Workflow Validated (NEW): Practice 03 was analyzed entirely from IBT file—no G61 CSV exports needed. Session extraction tool provides lap times, sector times, corner times, and consistency metrics. Now includes automatic OUTLAP DETECTION (excludes Lap 1 if >1.5s slower than median). IBT technique analysis adds oversteer patterns, tire temps, weight transfer. G61 exports are now optional/backup, not required.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit MASTERED (Race Validated): σ progression: 2.257s (lottery) → 0.219s (shaky) → 0.066s (DIALED). 97% improvement over 3 sessions. Corner mastered UNDER RACE PRESSURE—not just in practice. The consistency-first approach (Practice 03) paid off when stakes were real.",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0 Win Streak (6/7 UPDATED): Winton AI (P11→P1), Lime Rock AI x3 (P5→P1, P6→P1, P2*), Oschersleben AI x2 (P6→P1, P1). *P2 was deliberate aggression test. Pattern: survive L1-L3 at 80-85%, attack L4+ when field spreads. Now proven at 3 different tracks. The contract is not track-specific—it's a universal race strategy.",
    "Oschersleben Overtaking Strategy: Main straight into T1-T2 is THE spot. Requirements: (1) Clean T14 Zeppelin exit, (2) Slipstream on Stadiongerade, (3) Late brake into Hotel complex. Limited overtaking options = patience required. This track rewards chess, not checkers.",
    "Final Lap Performance Pattern: AI Race 01 fastest lap was Lap 8 (final lap). Race pace IMPROVED throughout as tires came in and traffic cleared. This indicates: (1) Good tire management (not overheating early), (2) Mental composure under pressure, (3) Understanding that fastest laps come when you stop fighting and start flowing.",
    "Overnight Corner Processing (NEW): T12 Amman Kurve went from σ 0.276s (only flagged corner in Race 01) to σ 0.069s (dialed) in Race 02 with NO explicit practice between sessions. The brain processes and consolidates corner technique during sleep. Don't underestimate 'doing nothing' as part of the learning process. Reps + Rest = Mastery.",
    "Track Mastery Achieved (Oschersleben): AI Race 02 showed 14/14 corners DIALED (σ < 0.10s). First track in Season 01 with complete corner mastery. Progression: Day 1 = 2 corners dialed. Day 4 = 14/14 dialed. The 'consistency-first' approach (Practice 03) unlocked this by removing fear and allowing natural limit-finding.",
    "Low-Stakes Races as Test Sessions (NEW): AI Race 02 competition was weak initially, but required 4 laps of defensive driving (L5-L8). Master Lonn deployed center line defense (first time ever) and set PB (1:32.933) on Lap 7 WHILE defending. This disproves 'PBs need relaxed mind' — pace can come from competitive pressure too.",
    "Center Line Defense (NEW TECHNIQUE): First time Master Lonn used deliberate defensive positioning. Technique: Take center line on straights/approaches, denying clean overtake on both inside AND outside. Forces attacker to commit to a side, allows defender to react. Result: Held P1 for 4 laps against pressure, 0 incidents, PB mid-defense. This is a sustainable defense strategy (vs blocking which loses speed).",
    "PB Under Defensive Pressure (NEW): AI Race 02 Lap 7 PB (1:32.933) came while defending position, not in clear air. This contradicts assumption that best pace requires 'relaxed mind.' The competitive pressure (someone on your tail) can sharpen focus and extract pace. Defending ≠ slowing down. Defending WITH pace = elite racecraft.",
    "Lift-on-Steer Pattern (NEW): IBT analysis revealed 'throttle lift when adding steering' pattern — classic commitment issue. T9 Chicane Exit was worst offender (23%). Cause: brain says 'rotation = danger' so foot instinctively lifts. Irony: the lift CAUSES instability (weight transfer forward, light rear). Fix: pick throttle %, HOLD through steering input. 8 laps of focused practice reduced T9 from 23% → 17%. T7 Hairpin went from 10.4% → 0.5% (fully rewired). Pattern can be broken with conscious effort.",
    "Focused Drill Methodology (NEW): Short practice sessions (8-10 laps) with ONE specific focus are more effective than long 'try to be faster' sessions. Smooth Input Drill: focus on throttle commitment, not lap times. Result: nearly matched PB anyway + measurable technique improvement. For ADHD brain, small focused bites > long unfocused sessions.",
    "FFB Tuning (MAIRA 35% → 30%): Reducing FFB strength by 5% resulted in 13% smoother steering overall, up to 29% smoother in tight corners (chicane). Jerk σ dropped from 17.25 to 15.44. Consistency IMPROVED (σ 0.70s → 0.515s) and pace held (nearly matched PB). Strong FFB causes micro-corrections that show up as steering jerk. Less fighting the wheel = more flow. 30% MAIRA strength is the new baseline for FF1600.",
    "Smooth Input Transfer (Practice → Race): AI Race 03 proved that conscious smooth input practice transfers to race conditions. Steering jerk: Practice 11.3 rad/s² → Race 11.43 rad/s² (only 1.2% increase under race pressure). This confirms neural rewiring is happening—the smooth inputs aren't just temporary focus, they're becoming habit. The FFB reduction + focused drill + race deployment = validated workflow for technique changes.",
    "S2 Elite Consistency Under Pressure: AI Race 03 showed S2 σ = 0.103s (100 milliseconds variance) across 7 flying laps IN A RACE. This is professional-level consistency in the technical middle sector. Proves that when technique is dialed, it holds under traffic and pressure.",
    "Yield to Faster Cars (Meebewegen 2.0): AI Race 03 taught the hard way: if someone is genuinely faster, let them go. P2 > P10 + broken ego. Master Lonn's reflection: 'He was faster... when he made the move I should have let him go.' This extends Meebewegen from 'let faster guys through early' to 'yield when defending costs more than it gains.' Defending a position you can't hold = gambling. P2 is not losing—it's maximizing the realistic outcome.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit: Race vs Practice Dichotomy (NEW): T2 σ in practice = 0.066s (DIALED). T2 σ in races when fighting for P1 = 1.0+ (LOTTERY). Same corner, same driver, same car — different results. The difference is PRESSURE/TRAFFIC. When someone contests T2: (1) Options reduce (can't take normal line), (2) Braking point shifts (defensive/offensive), (3) Commitment drops (fear of contact). Four consecutive races (Race 03-04-05-AI) had T2 incidents cost potential wins. The solution isn't getting faster at T2 — it's NOT FIGHTING at T2. Fight for P1 everywhere else.",
    "The Hotel Rule (NEW): Don't fight for P1 AT T2. If contested at T2: Option A = let them have T2, attack at T3-T6 (Triple complex). Option B = let them have T2, set up slipstream for T14→main straight. Option C = if genuinely faster, let them go (Meebewegen 2.0). The Hotel is not where you WIN — it's where you LOSE.",
    "Steering Smoothness Progression (NEW): Race 02: 12.98 rad/s² → Race 03: 11.43 (-12%) → Race 04: 10.15 (-11%) → Race 05: 10.98. Neural rewiring continues. Smooth input drills + FFB reduction producing measurable, sustained improvement. Now consistently under 11 rad/s².",
    "T2 Hotel Exit Technique SOLVED (Master Lonn Discovery): Trail brake entry → Full brake + quick downshift 4→3→2 → 20% THROTTLE HOLD through apex → Progressive throttle to 100% on exit. KEY INSIGHT: Never fully off throttle through the apex. The 20% hold stabilizes the rear on the downhill decreasing-radius corner. Without it = light rear = snap oversteer = disaster. This matches VRS Gideon technique ('overlap throttle with brakes to stabilize rear'). Master Lonn reverse-engineered it through feel. Now codified for deployment under race pressure.",
    "PB Under Adversity (Official Race Proof): Sleep-deprived + P10 start + mid-race contact = NEW PB anyway. Lap 6 was 1:32.700, one lap BEFORE the incident. The pace was REAL, not lucky. Recovery lap after incident was 1:33.833 (solid composure). Feeling 'awful' and performing well are not mutually exclusive. The systems (Cold Tire Contract, technique foundations) work even when the driver doesn't feel sharp. Trust the process.",
    "Official Race PB Pattern (NEW): AI Race 02 PB came while defending (competitive pressure). Official Race PB came while building through traffic (strategic patience). Both were NOT in clear air. PBs don't require perfect conditions—they require the right mental state (flow, not forcing). The common thread: commit to the process, let speed come as byproduct.",
    "T2 Hotel Exit MASTERY COMPLETE (2026-01-15): The Achilles heel is dead. T2 σ in today's official race = 0.153s (SOLID) with traffic. Progression complete: 2.257s (lottery) → 0.219s (shaky) → 0.066s (dialed in practice) → 0.153s (solid in race). The technique (20% throttle hold through apex) is now muscle memory. T2 is just a corner now, not a nemesis. The 'Race vs Practice Dichotomy' no longer applies—technique holds under pressure.",
    "Oran Park GP Track Character (NEW): 9 corners, 5 sectors. Heavy elevation changes define this track. Champion Curve (blind entry, tightening radius, elevation) is the 'Hotel Exit' equivalent - where laps go to die. Foster's Dip produces 3.3G compression load through the dip. The Sweeper + Coca-Cola are a linked complex. O'Brien Dogleg is flat out. BB 55% produces perfectly balanced tire temps.",
    "New Track Learning Efficiency (NEW): First stint at Oran Park yielded 5-second improvement in 23 minutes (1:17.4 → 1:12.5) despite multiple offs and spins. 6/9 corners SOLID on Day 1 (67% dialed on first contact). The offs at Champion Curve and Foster's Dip were part of the learning process — pushed, found limits, recovered, got faster. PB came on Lap 14 AFTER the drama, not before.",
    "Gong Comparison (Oran Park GP): 2.7s gap to alien (1:12.583 vs 1:09.856). Key findings: (1) The Sweeper is NOT a brake zone - Lonn braking 75% of corner vs Gong 42%, losing 22 km/h through. (2) Champion Curve apex speed 9 km/h slower, lat G 0.21 lower. (3) HIDDEN LOSS at Momo Corner - looked 'consistent' but 11 km/h slower than Gong! (4) Full throttle usage 66.6% vs Gong 72.3% (-5.7%). (5) Overdriving 24% of lap. Top speed identical - gap is ALL corner speed and throttle commitment.",
    "The Sweeper Technique (Oran Park): LIFT, DON'T BRAKE. This corner before Coca-Cola should be taken at 160+ km/h with minimal or no braking. Gong carries 22 km/h more through by treating it as a lift zone, not a brake zone. Master Lonn's instinct to brake here costs ~0.2-0.3s alone.",
    "Champion Curve Mastery (Practice 02 Breakthrough): Single-corner focus for 2 sessions resulted in 92% improvement (0.898s → 0.072s σ). Both Entry and Exit went from lottery/work-needed to DIALED. Apex Exit precision: 0.2m σ (laser). Key technique: feeling-based learning (not overthinking), progressive commitment (cautious early, aggressive later), repetition. This validates 'conquer ONE corner fully before attacking the next' philosophy. Champion Curve is now a reference standard.",
    "Foster's Dip Complex (NEW): Compound corner with elevation + compression + blind entry. Entry drops into dip (3.3G compression), Exit climbs out. When right, it's fast. When wrong, it ejects the car. Practice 02: Entry σ 0.308s (apex wandering 19.3m), Exit σ 1.556s (speed variance 30.17 km/h!). Lap 8 catastrophic off (8.15s corner vs 2.033s best). Lap 9 stopped (0.2 km/h). The compound nature chains errors: bad Entry → bad Exit. Requires POSITIONING over bravery. Trust compression = front tire load = less braking needed mid-corner.",
    "Coca-Cola Brake Point Drift (NEW): Practice 01 (solid 0.221s σ) → Practice 02 (lottery 0.489s σ). Brake point wandering 45.6m lap-to-lap (~2 car lengths!). Cause: pushing harder post-Champion Curve mastery, no consistent visual marker. When braking early = fine. When braking late = oversteer (2083 events, highest of any corner). Fix: Pick ONE brake marker, hit it every lap. Entry speed might need sacrifice for exit stability. Consistent 6.8s corner > 6.6s/8.6s lottery.",
    "Limit-Finding vs Consistency Trade-Off (NEW): Practice 01 (safe, consistent 1.539s σ, slow 1:12.583) vs Practice 02 (aggressive, chaotic 2.064s σ, fast 1:11.617). Traded consistency for pace discovery. This is CORRECT for practice. The offs taught where the limit is. Lap 16 proves clean 1:11.617 is achievable. Now job is to repeat it without drama. You can't discover the edge without falling off it a few times.",
    "Sequential Corner Mastery (NEW PRINCIPLE): Conquer ONE corner fully before attacking the next. Champion Curve (Week 06 focus) was mastered in 2 sessions (92% improvement). This freed mental bandwidth to push elsewhere (Foster's Dip, Coca-Cola). Result: new speed found, new problems discovered. This is the natural progression of limit-finding. Don't fix everything at once—systematic, sequential improvement is faster.",
    "Corners Connecting Validation (NEW): Practice 03 validated Master Lonn's feeling of 'corners connecting.' Data proof: S1, S2, S4, S5 all sub-0.25s σ. 9/12 corners solid or better (75% of track). Steering jerk IMPROVED (15.62 → 14.5 rad/s²) despite pushing harder. This is flow—track becoming a sequence, not isolated corners. The feeling of momentum chaining is now backed by numbers. Consistency in 4/5 sectors means the car is linking sections together smoothly.",
    "Yokohama Bridge Hidden Problem (NEW): Master Lonn mentioned Foster's Dip spins but NOT Yokohama Bridge—yet data reveals it's equally problematic. Apex wandering 54.7m (twenty car lengths!), σ 0.413s, speed variance 11.63 km/h, Lap 7 disaster (67.2 km/h vs 120+ km/h normal). It's a blind high-speed kink before Foster's with elevation + no reference point. The 'surprising spins' weren't random—they happened at the TWO lottery corners (Foster's + Yokohama), both sharing: blind entry, high speed, elevation change, no clear reference. This pattern identification is KEY for solving both.",
    "Limit-Finding PB Pattern (NEW): Practice 03 set NEW PB (1:11.200) while having FOUR offs. This isn't contradiction—it's limit-finding. You can't find the edge without crossing it. The clean PB lap (Lap 12) came MID-SESSION, proving the offs taught where the limit is. Then more offs (Lap 14-15) pushing even harder. Result: 0.533s gap to optimal (basically AT the limit now). The remaining 0.45-0.7s lives in just TWO corners (Foster's + Yokohama). This validates the methodology: push, find edge, consolidate, repeat.",
    "Steering Smoothness While Limit-Finding (NEW): Practice 03 steering jerk IMPROVED (15.62 → 14.5 rad/s², -7%) despite: setting PB, having 4 offs, pushing harder (59.3% full throttle). This proves learning is happening—fewer corrections needed as track familiarity builds. Even when limit-finding is chaotic (4 offs), underlying technique is improving. Neural adaptation continues: smooth inputs becoming automatic, not conscious effort. This is sustainable speed.",
    "Champion Curve Mastery Maintained (NEW): Practice 02: Entry 0.072s σ, Exit 0.052s σ (MASTERED). Practice 03: Entry 0.052s σ, Exit 0.142s σ (STILL MASTERED). The corner stayed dialed after being conquered. This proves 'conquer and maintain' is achievable—once a corner is truly learned, it stays learned even when pushing elsewhere. Champion Curve is now reference standard for what 'dialed' means (< 0.15s σ, apex precision, repeatable). Apply this same process to Foster's + Yokohama.",
    "75% Track Consistency Milestone (NEW): Practice 03: 9/12 corners solid+ (75%), 4/5 sectors sub-0.25s σ. This is a consistency threshold—when 3/4 of track is dialed, the track stops being 'a series of corners' and becomes 'a flow.' Master Lonn's comment 'I start to find how corners connect' is validated by crossing this 75% threshold. The remaining 25% (Foster's + Yokohama + one sector S3) is where the remaining speed lives. This is late-stage track learning—most of the track is solved, now fine-tuning the hard bits.",
    "Foster's Dip Technique Discovery - Data Validated (NEW): Master Lonn discovered Foster's Entry technique during Practice 03: 'Very light on brakes before the curbs on the left turning in. Don't touch the curbs on the left, guaranteed spin.' Data proof: THREE best times (3.183s, 3.183s, 3.200s) on Laps 12, 17, 22 ALL after discovery. After catastrophic off (Lap 14: 7.867s), he REPEATED best time on Lap 17 - proof of learned technique, not luck. Physics validates it: Foster's has 3.3G compression = free front grip. Heavy braking BEFORE compression overloads fronts. Light braking + early turn-in + trust compression + avoid left curbs = platform stability. The technique chain: (1) Light brake before dip (set platform), (2) Turn in early, (3) Let compression rotate car, (4) Avoid left curbs (no lateral disturbance), (5) Trust grip, commit exit. This is self-discovered technique backed by data.",
    "Brake Bias 56% Discovery (Oran Park, NEW): Master Lonn changed BB from 55% → 56% for Practice 03, noted it felt 'more stable in the beginning.' Physics explanation: 1% more front bias = more front tire loading under braking = sharper turn-in bite + less rear lock-up tendency = more predictable front behavior. This explains: (1) Champion Curve Entry mastery maintained (0.052s σ), (2) Coca-Cola brake σ improved 21% (45.6m → 36.2m), (3) Steering smoothness improved 7% (15.62 → 14.5 rad/s²) despite pushing harder. More front authority = car listens better. The 'stable in the beginning' feeling is REAL - fronts have more braking authority, so turn-in is more predictable. Trade-off: slightly less ultimate braking power (rears not working as hard). For Oran Park (slow/medium corners), 56% is optimal. Setup changes should be validated by feel AND data.",
    "Foster's Dip Mastery Complete (Week 06, UPDATED): P03 self-discovery technique → P04 MUSCLE MEMORY. Entry σ: 0.962s (P03 chaos) → 0.060s (P04 dialed) = 93% improvement. Exit σ: 0.413s (P03 lottery) → 0.042s (P04 dialed) = 90% improvement. Apex precision: 18.5m (P03) → 13.8m Entry, 0.2m Exit (P04). Exit apex precision of 0.2m = TWENTY CENTIMETERS = reference standard. Speed variance Exit: 18.87 km/h (P03) → 4.06 km/h (P04) = 78% improvement. Brake consistency: 5.1m σ (hitting same spot every lap). The technique (light brakes before dip, early turn-in, trust 3.3G compression, avoid left curbs, 20% throttle hold through apex) is now AUTOMATIC. Two-session transformation: discovery (P03) → mastery (P04). Foster's is now a WEAPON for racing (can attack here while others are cautious).",
    "Yokohama Bridge Diagnosis (NEW): The ONLY remaining problem corner (71.6m apex wander, 11.59 km/h speed variance, steering jerk 26.86 rad/s² = HIGHEST of any corner). Issue: treating it like a corner when it's a HIGH-SPEED KINK. Blind entry + elevation change + no clear reference point = second-guessing mid-corner. Peak lat G 3.32G proves car CAN do it—problem is CONFIDENCE, not capability. Fix: (1) Pick EXIT marker (right-side rumble strip), not apex. (2) Point car at exit from entry. (3) One smooth steering input, HOLD IT, done. (4) Lift if needed (don't scrub speed with corrections). Best laps through Yokohama (L16, L18, L22) all had minimal steering jerk + smooth commitment. This is 'point and shoot' not 'turn and apex.' For races: Yokohama is where passes happen (others lift/hesitate, you commit and flow through).",
    "Champion Exit One-Off Pattern (NEW): Lap 10 disaster (12.883s corner vs 2.1s avg = 10 seconds in gravel) was NOT a consistency problem—it was ONE mistake from pushing for PB. Entry was too aggressive (3.333s vs 3.433s avg = faster), carried too much speed into Exit, overloaded fronts, snap oversteer. Champion is a COMPOUND corner—Entry speed dictates Exit grip. This corner was dialed in P02 and P03 (0.052s σ Entry, 0.142s σ Exit). For races: prioritize Exit over Entry (Entry is blind, Exit sets up the straight). Go 2% slower into Entry if needed. Respect the Entry→Exit chain. No drill needed—already know this corner, just don't overdrive it.",
    "Four Consecutive PBs Pattern (Week 06, NEW): P01: 1:12.583 (baseline) → P02: 1:11.617 (-0.966s) → P03: 1:11.200 (-0.417s) → P04: 1:11.033 (-0.167s). Total: 1.55s improvement in 3 days (4 sessions). Progression shows: (1) Big initial gains from learning track (P01→P02), (2) Technique refinement (P02→P03), (3) Consistency at limit (P03→P04). Each PB was CLEAN (no offs on PB lap itself). P04 PB came on Lap 18 in clear air after recovering from Lap 10 off—shows resilience and ability to refocus. Gap to optimal: 0.533s (P03) → 0.25s (P04) = approaching absolute limit. Remaining time is in Yokohama smoothing (~0.15-0.20s) and Champion consistency (~0.05s). Ready for AI races.",
    "Pre-Race Readiness Indicators (NEW): Master Lonn's self-assessment 'more consistent, more in control' validated by data: 83% of track dialed (10/12 corners), gap to optimal 0.25s, four consecutive PBs, all Week 06 goals achieved. Key race prep indicators: (1) Foster's Dip is a WEAPON (dialed consistency, can attack here). (2) Brake consistency elite (6 corners < 6m σ). (3) Immediate recovery from mistakes (Lap 10 off → Lap 11 back to 1:11.850). (4) Tire temps perfectly balanced (BB 56% optimal, no setup changes needed). (5) Knows where remaining speed lives (Yokohama smoothing, Champion respect). Race strategy: consistency > speed (target 1:11.5-1:12.0 range, not PB hunting), Cold Tire Contract L1-2, deploy pace L3+, overtake at Foster's + main straight, defend at Recaro exit, mental reset if needed ('Just DRIVE'). The work is done—now it's DEPLOYMENT."
