    "DATA CORRECTION (Dec 28): AI Races analysis revised - 'Pressure = Focus' theory was INCORRECT. Pressure led to 5 incidents (errors). Consistency (0.39s) was due to driving alone in last place (free air).",
    "Cold Tire Contract v2.0: Laps 1-2 are SURVIVAL. 30-90 seconds of impulse control determines the race. No passing attempts on cold tires.",
    "Engine Braking > Trail Braking (FF1600): For light rear-engine cars, engine braking provides smoother rotation and less abrupt weight transfer than brake pedal (Winton T5 discovery).",
    "ADHD Impulse Pattern: When goal is ACTIVE (chasing), Master Lonn is strategic. When goal is ACHIEVED (position secured), brain creates artificial risk. Needs 'Position Secured Protocol'.",
    "Flow vs Fear: Flow state = reacting to NOW. Fear state = reacting to FUTURE ('what if I spin'). Flow must be entered via commitment, not caution.",
    "Hardware/Technique Link: Throttle overlap (resting foot) causes snap oversteer. Clean inputs must be verified before adjusting setup.",
    "Meebewegen (Strategic Patience): Go with the flow in early laps (80-90%), let chaos settle, then attack. Works for ADHD brain to reduce load.",
    "Race Pace Transfer: Practice pace transfers to Race pace almost 1:1 (0.1s gap) - speed is not the issue, race start cleanliness is.",
    "Short vs Tall Gear Stacks: Winton (Short) = forgiving, strong engine braking. Rudskogen (Tall) = precise, weak engine braking. Track personality dictates gear strategy.",
