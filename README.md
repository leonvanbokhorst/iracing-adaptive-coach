## What This Is

This is a **living research project** on **data-driven personalized learning** in complex skill domains, conducted by Leon van Bokhorst at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (Interaction Design research group, Conversational AI focus).

**The Experiment:** Can an AI coach (Little Padawan) + rich telemetry data + ADHD-adapted frameworks accelerate skill acquisition in sim racing?

**New!** 🫣 Read my blog at [little-padawan.vercel.app](https://little-padawan.vercel.app).

**The Evidence (So Far):**
- **+465 iRating** in 6 weeks (1238 → 1703)
- **Sequential Mastery framework** producing measurable corner-by-corner improvement
- **17-minute focused practice sessions** outperforming hour-long scattered training
- **Feeling + data alignment** producing locked-in learning (Week 07: 59% oversteer reduction in one session)
- **6 consecutive race victories** applying learned techniques under pressure

**What We're Proving:**
- AI + data + personalized frameworks = accelerated learning
- ADHD-adapted communication (short sessions, clear focus, emotional engagement) works measurably
- Sequential Mastery > scattered practice
- Conversational AI can coach complex motor skills when given proper tools and context
- Partnership between human intuition and AI analysis unlocks capabilities neither could achieve alone

All tracked, documented, validated, reproducible. 🏎️🔬

## Week 06: The Lesson (Oran Park)

Oran Park was supposed to be simple. Learn a new track. Race clean. Bank points. Move on.

Instead, Master Lonn learned what separates fast drivers from championship drivers: knowing when to walk away.

The week started clean. A track he'd never seen—blind crests, elevation changes, corners that bit back. Champion Curve was a 3-second lottery on Day 1. By Day 3, it was a 0.052s laser. Foster's Dip, a terrifying compression that threw the car sideways, became a weapon when he discovered the trick: trust the 3.3G load. Light brakes, early turn-in, let physics do the work.

Four consecutive practice PBs. 1.55 seconds dropped in three days. By Practice 04, he was sitting on 1:11.033, gap to optimal just 0.25s. The track was dialed. 83% of corners locked in.

Then came race day. Four races in five hours.

**Race 01** (08:55): Qualified P4. Got caught in a crash at Coca-Cola, lost 8 seconds, but reset instantly. Set his fastest lap on the FINAL lap. P6, 55 points banked. The Banker strategy worked.

**Race 02** (11:31): Top split demolition derby. Punted from behind at Coca-Cola. Drove into another unavoidable crash. Two meatball flags. DNF. 10x incidents. iRating -46. The pace was there (1:12.767, faster than quali), but the track was a war zone.

**Race 03** (11:57): The reset. Qualified P5, finished P7. Best lap 1:11.500. Consistency 0.796s (ELITE). 10 out of 12 corners dialed. Drove into a spinner (3x, unavoidable), but brought the car home. **67 championship points**. iRating +24, clawing back from Race 02.

He should have stopped there.

**Race 04** (12:27): Didn't qualify. Started P9. Wanted to test meebewegen from the back. Got caught in chaos anyway. Another meatball. 4x. Best lap 1:11.750—**slower** than Race 03. P8 finish. iRating -20.

And then it hit him. The point system (best 1 of 4 races) meant **Race 03's 67 points WAS his week score**. Race 04 was unnecessary risk that gained nothing and cost iRating.

His words: *"If I had known we earned 67 points, I would have stopped."*

That's the lesson Oran Park taught him. Championship racing isn't about how fast you can go. It's about knowing when you've already won.

## The Journey So Far

### Week 05: The Hotel's Revenge (Oschersleben)

Oschersleben is honest. It asks one question: *Can you hit your marks?*

Master Lonn arrived with GR86 muscle memory that betrayed him in the FF1600. T2 Hotel Exit became a nightmare—a decreasing radius downhill corner that snapped the rear axle and cost race wins.

Five AI races. Three potential victories lost to T2.

But he didn't quit. He went back to the lab. He reverse-engineered the aliens. He found the technique: **20% throttle hold through the apex**. It stabilized the rear.

In the final official race, on no sleep and starting P10, he drove through the field. T2 was mastered (σ 0.153s). He finished P4 with 0 incidents. The Achilles heel was dead.

### Week 04: The Ninja (Lime Rock Park)

"From 'No Clue' to Top Split Podium."

It started with frustration at The Uphill (T5). It ended with beating the Series #1 driver through that exact corner.

The breakthrough came from Chapter 16: **Edge Mapping**. Master Lonn applied the drill and instantly found 0.8s. In the Top Split official race (SoF 2035), he qualified P2. When a faster driver attacked, he didn't fight—he deployed **Meebewegen**. He let them through, stayed clean, and took a P3 podium with 94 championship points. Ninja > Barbarian.

### Week 03: The Robot (Winton)

"Boring is just another word for Perfection."

Master Lonn returned to Winton and turned into a metronome. **1:25.710**. Consistency σ **0.16s**. He won by being so relentlessly consistent that opponents crashed trying to keep up.

This was the week of the **Cold Tire Contract**: giving up Laps 1-2 to survive, then attacking from Lap 3. It became the foundation of his racecraft.

### Week 02: The Rust (Rudskogen)

Six months away from this track. The rust was real. T2 was a disaster.

But he chipped away at it. Found the "50 sign" brake marker. Beat his July PB by 0.4s. Scored a Top 500 global ranking time.

The lesson? **Strategic Maturity**. In a chaotic race, he recognized "P3 is secured," backed off 5%, and brought the car home. A driver became a racer.

### Week 01: The Beginning (Jefferson)

He arrived running 51.4s, scared of the walls. He left running 50.5s, with a race victory and a podium.

The discovery of **Flow State**. "Easy flying." The realization that trying less means going faster.

---

## The Driver

**Master Lonn** isn't just fast. He's a **Systems Thinker**.

He doesn't just drive laps; he builds protocols. The *Cold Tire Contract*. The *Position Secured Protocol*. The *Pit Crew Protocol*.

He has ADHD, which means his brain craves novelty but struggles with impulse. The systems are the guardrails. When the red mist descends, the protocol takes over.

He's learned that **Success** (P6, 55 points) is different from **Satisfaction** ("I wanted P1"). He's learned that **Resilience** (resetting after a crash) is worth more than raw speed.

He is currently ranked **Top 0.4%** globally. And he's just getting started.
