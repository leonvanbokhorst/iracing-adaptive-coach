## Week 09: The French Rollercoaster 🎢

_Currently practicing at Circuit de Lédenon_

The French rollercoaster opened its arms and asked for a dance.

Master Lonn arrived at Lédenon carrying the weight of Week 08—three official races at VIR North, iRating down 35 points despite technique sharper than ever. Roller Coaster σ = 0.082s. Snake brake point σ = 0.2 meters. Machine-like precision that didn't translate to standings. Sometimes racing gives you everything but the result.

Lédenon was supposed to be the reset. Eight corners carved into southern French terrain, blind crests hiding apexes, compressions spiking grip just when you need it. Anti-clockwise, which meant long sequences of medium-speed lefts testing his weaker side. The track dossier warned: *"The first few sessions can feel claustrophobic and chaotic."*

Eleven laps. Zero incidents. And by the twelfth, the track revealed itself.

> *"What a beautiful rollercoaster... I like it... flowy... asks to dance... last corner is weird."*

That instinct—the ability to feel what the numbers take 1,000 samples to confirm—is what separates good drivers from great ones. S2 consistency: 0.409s. The "flowy" section. La cuvette variance: 0.497s. The "weird" corner. His nervous system had already mapped the track's personality.

**1:30.350** on the final lap. Not hunting for it. Just... arriving.

Then the Gong comparison dropped. 4.752 seconds. Almost five seconds to the alien. And the diagnosis surprised everyone:

**Not overdriving. Underdriving.**

Gong pulls 2.82 G through corners. Master Lonn: 2.56 G. At La servie alone—the biggest single loss at 0.69s—Gong loads the tires to 2.65 G while Master Lonn tiptoes at 1.89 G. Three-quarters of a G unused. The car has grip. His brain says "careful."

But one corner proves the technique exists: La Courmelle. Only 0.02 seconds off Gong's pace. Zero oversteer events. σ = 0.056s. When he commits, he matches the alien.

The fix isn't trying harder. It's trusting more.

**Week 09 Status:** Day 1 complete. 5/8 corners already dialed (62.5%). La cuvette is the focus—blind compression corner, VIR Roller Coaster v2. ~2.1s addressable through commitment alone.

The dance has begun.

## The Journey So Far

### Week 08: The Dancing Circuit

Three official races at VIR North. P8, P10, P7. iRating dropped 35 points. But the technique? Machine-like.

He'd arrived expecting to fight the rust—two years since his last lap at VIR. Instead, his hands already knew the way. *"It's flowy. It's a dancing circuit."*

The Roller Coaster demanded commitment. Day two, it bit him twice—two spectacular crashes mid-corner. The data said NEW PB 1:31.433. The crashes weren't wrong technique; they were hesitation meeting physics.

Day three, something clicked. Five consecutive sub-1:31 laps. Zero crashes. Day four: POLE POSITION in the AI race. **1:30.283**. Roller Coaster σ = 0.082s. Snake brake point σ = 0.2 meters.

The races didn't convert the pace. Trading paint, caught in battles, positions that slipped away. But the technique was bulletproof.

Sometimes you win the war and lose the battles.

### Week 07: Second Nature

Seven months away from Summit Point. First lap back: 1.4 seconds faster than his old PB. Compound growth revealed.

Two TOP SPLIT races. P5 (SoF 2045) with T5 brake σ = 1.0 meter. P9 (SoF 2674) against Division 1-4 aliens—_"I'm gonna die. And I love it."_

The technique became automatic. **P2 Division 8. P6 Dutch. Top 0.35%.**

### Week 06: The Lesson

Four consecutive practice PBs. 1.55 seconds dropped in three days. Champion Curve mastered—92% improvement.

Then race day. Four races in five hours. Race 03 was perfect: P7, 67 points, 0.796s σ. That was the week's score.

But he didn't stop. Race 04 cost iRating and gained nothing.

The lesson: _Know When To Stop_.

### Week 05: The Hotel's Revenge

T2 Hotel Exit—a decreasing radius downhill that snapped the rear and cost race wins. Five AI races. Three potential victories lost to one corner.

He went back to the lab. Found the technique: 20% throttle hold through the apex to stabilize the rear. In the final official, starting P10, he drove through the field.

The Achilles heel was dead.

### Week 04: The Ninja

The breakthrough came from Edge Mapping—finding spatial limits at 70% pace, then deploying at 100%.

In the Top Split (SoF 2035), when a faster driver attacked, he deployed Meebewegen. Let them through. Stayed clean. P3 podium.

Ninja > Barbarian.

### Week 03: The Robot

Master Lonn became a metronome. Consistency σ = 0.16s. He won by being so relentlessly consistent that opponents crashed trying to keep up.

This was the week of the Cold Tire Contract: survive Laps 1-2, attack from Lap 3.

### Week 02: The Rust

Six months away. T2 was a disaster. But he found the "50 sign" brake marker. Beat his July PB by 0.4s.

The lesson: Strategic Maturity. "P3 is secured." Back off 5%. Bring the car home.

### Week 01: The Beginning

He arrived running 51.4s. He left running 50.5s with a race victory.

The discovery of Flow State. _"Easy flying."_ The realization that trying less means going faster.

## The Driver

**Master Lonn** isn't just fast. He's a **Systems Thinker**.

He doesn't just drive laps; he builds protocols. The _Cold Tire Contract_. The _Position Secured Protocol_. The _Sequential Mastery Framework_. When the red mist descends, the protocol takes over.

He has ADHD, which means his brain craves novelty but struggles with impulse. The systems are the guardrails.

He's learned that **Success** (P137, 67 points) is different from **Satisfaction** ("I wanted P1"). He's learned that **Resilience**—resetting after a crash in one lap—is worth more than raw speed.

He is currently ranked **Top 0.35%** globally with **1684 iRating** (+446 this season).

**Division 8**. **P6 among Dutch drivers**. Nine weeks in.

After eight weeks of data-driven coaching, he doesn't wonder if the training works.

He knows. The numbers proved it. And Week 09, the French rollercoaster is teaching him something new: trust.

## What This Is

A **living research project** on **data-driven personalized learning** in complex skill domains, conducted by Leon van Bokhorst at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (Interaction Design research group, Conversational AI focus).

**The Experiment:** Can an AI coach (Little Padawan) + rich telemetry data + ADHD-adapted frameworks accelerate skill acquisition in sim racing?

**The Evidence:**

- **+446 iRating** in 8 weeks (1238 → 1684, +36%)
- **Top 0.35%** globally
- **P6 Dutch** out of 672 drivers
- **Official TOP SPLIT P5** (SoF 2045) with only 1x incident
- **POLE POSITION** at VIR North (AI Race weekend)
- **T5 brake point σ = 1.0 METER** under TOP SPLIT race pressure
- **Roller Coaster σ = 0.082s** after commitment breakthrough
- **5/8 corners dialed on DAY 1** at new track (Lédenon)
- **Underdriving diagnosis** — data revealing 0.26 G of untapped grip
- **Feel-data sync** — instincts matching numbers within first session

All tracked. All documented. All reproducible. 🏎️🔬
