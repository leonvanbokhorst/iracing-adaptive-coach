## What This Is

This is a **living research project** on **data-driven personalized learning** in complex skill domains, conducted by Leon van Bokhorst at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (Interaction Design research group, Conversational AI focus).

**The Experiment:** Can an AI coach (Little Padawan) + rich telemetry data + ADHD-adapted frameworks accelerate skill acquisition in sim racing?

**New!** 🫣 Read my blog at [little-padawan.vercel.app](https://little-padawan.vercel.app).

**The Evidence (So Far):**
- **+503 iRating** in 7 weeks (1238 → 1741) — climbing toward **Top 0.3%**
- **Official TOP SPLIT P5** (SoF 2045) in Week 07 with only 1x incident
- **T5 brake point σ = 1.0 METER** — verbal cueing → automatic execution validated
- **Sequential Mastery framework** producing 97% corner improvement in a single day
- **17-minute focused practice sessions** outperforming hour-long scattered training
- **Voice-telemetry correlation** (EXP-02) proving verbal self-cueing works under race pressure
- **10/10 corners dialed** at Summit Point under TOP SPLIT official racing conditions

**What We're Proving:**
- AI + data + personalized frameworks = accelerated learning
- ADHD-adapted communication (short sessions, clear focus, emotional engagement) works measurably
- Sequential Mastery > scattered practice
- Conversational AI can coach complex motor skills when given proper tools and context
- Partnership between human intuition and AI analysis unlocks capabilities neither could achieve alone

All tracked, documented, validated, reproducible. 🏎️🔬

## Week 07: Second Nature (Summit Point Main Circuit)

There's a moment when everything stops being technique and becomes instinct. When the words you've drilled become muscle memory. When "no trail braking" isn't something you think—it's something your hands do.

Master Lonn found that moment at Summit Point.

He returned after seven months away, expecting rust. Instead, his first lap was 1.4 seconds faster than his old PB. The growth from Weeks 01-06 had compounded into something invisible until tested.

Day two, seventeen minutes of focused drilling: T5 coasting, T1 late braking. No lap time chasing. Just repetition. 59% oversteer reduction at the Carousel. PB matched without trying. That evening, a flow session—"just have fun"—produced a **NEW PB: 1:15.550**. The morning's work had bedded in during play.

The AI races proved it held under pressure. An epic battle with "Steve" in Race 03—lost the lead, went off-track, chased him down, made contact twice, reclaimed P1, defended through a misshift. *"I'm one fast son of a bitch."*

But the real test came Tuesday.

**Official Race 01. TOP SPLIT. SoF 2045.** Division 1-2 drivers. The real thing.

He botched qualifying—two off-tracks, no time, P10 start. In a field of aliens, he was starting from the back. Everything about this setup said "damage limitation mode."

He deployed Meebewegen from the lights. Let the aggressive car through—*"let him wreck himself."* Pressured Sato until he spun. Collected positions through patience and consistency.

"No trail braking," he said eight times during the race. A mantra. A meditation. The T5 Carousel Entry brake point data came back: **σ = 1.0 METER**. One meter variance across ten race laps. Against TOP SPLIT competition. With traffic and pressure and strategy.

When he crossed the line P5, he knew what it meant. Not just the result. The technique. The training. All of it.

**"Feels like second nature,"** he said mid-race. That phrase captured everything. The conscious → automatic transition complete. The verbal cue triggering neural pathways that no longer needed conscious thought.

P10 → P5. Only 1x incident. +38 iRating. **76 championship points**.

*"Hell yeah! That was a good race. I did pretty well."*

Three more attempts this week to beat 76. The system protects him—only the best result counts. But he's already proven what matters: the methodology works under TOP SPLIT pressure.

## The Journey So Far

### Week 06: The Lesson (Oran Park)

Oran Park was supposed to be simple. Learn a new track. Race clean. Bank points.

Instead, Master Lonn learned what separates fast drivers from championship drivers: knowing when to walk away.

Four consecutive practice PBs. 1.55 seconds dropped in three days. Champion Curve mastered (92% improvement). Foster's Dip technique self-discovered—light brakes before the compression, trust the 3.3G load, let physics do the work.

Then came race day. Four races in five hours. Race 03 was perfect: P7 finish, 67 championship points, 0.796s σ (ELITE), resilience proven. **That was the week score.**

But he didn't stop. Race 04 cost iRating and gained nothing. The lesson: *Know When To Stop*.

### Week 05: The Hotel's Revenge (Oschersleben)

T2 Hotel Exit—a decreasing radius downhill corner that snapped the rear and cost race wins. Five AI races. Three potential victories lost to one corner.

He went back to the lab. Reverse-engineered the aliens. Found the technique: 20% throttle hold through the apex to stabilize the rear.

In the final official race, on no sleep, starting P10, he drove through the field. T2 was mastered (σ 0.153s). The Achilles heel was dead.

### Week 04: The Ninja (Lime Rock Park)

From "No Clue" to Top Split Podium.

The breakthrough came from Edge Mapping—finding the spatial limits at 70% pace, then deploying at 100%. S3 consistency improved 56%. In the Top Split (SoF 2035), when a faster driver attacked, he deployed Meebewegen. Let them through. Stayed clean. P3 podium. Ninja > Barbarian.

### Week 03: The Robot (Winton)

Master Lonn became a metronome. 1:25.710. Consistency σ 0.16s. He won by being so relentlessly consistent that opponents crashed trying to keep up.

This was the week of the Cold Tire Contract: survive Laps 1-2, attack from Lap 3. It became the foundation of his racecraft.

### Week 02: The Rust (Rudskogen)

Six months away. The rust was real. T2 was a disaster.

But he chipped away at it. Found the "50 sign" brake marker. Beat his July PB by 0.4s. Scored a Top 500 global ranking time.

The lesson: Strategic Maturity. In a chaotic race, he recognized "P3 is secured," backed off 5%, and brought the car home.

### Week 01: The Beginning (Jefferson)

He arrived running 51.4s, scared of the walls. He left running 50.5s, with a race victory and a podium.

The discovery of Flow State. "Easy flying." The realization that trying less means going faster.

## The Driver

**Master Lonn** isn't just fast. He's a **Systems Thinker**.

He doesn't just drive laps; he builds protocols. The *Cold Tire Contract*. The *Position Secured Protocol*. The *Pit Crew Protocol*. The *Sequential Mastery Framework*.

He has ADHD, which means his brain craves novelty but struggles with impulse. The systems are the guardrails. When the red mist descends, the protocol takes over.

He's learned that **Success** (P137, 67 points) is different from **Satisfaction** ("I wanted P1"). He's learned that **Resilience** (resetting after a crash in one lap) is worth more than raw speed.

He's learned that **increments getting smaller** doesn't mean growth stopping—it means reaching the next phase. The gains from "stop crashing" are done. Now it's fractions of seconds against people who've been doing this for years.

He is currently ranked **Top 0.35%** globally with **1741 iRating** (+503 this season). And after Week 07's TOP SPLIT P5, he's not wondering if the training works under real pressure.

He knows. It *feels like second nature*.
