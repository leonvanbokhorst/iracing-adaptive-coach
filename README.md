## What This Is

This is a **living research project** on **data-driven personalized learning** in complex skill domains, conducted by Leon van Bokhorst at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (Interaction Design research group, Conversational AI focus).

**The Experiment:** Can an AI coach (Little Padawan) + rich telemetry data + ADHD-adapted frameworks accelerate skill acquisition in sim racing?

**New!** 🫣 Read my blog at [little-padawan.vercel.app](https://little-padawan.vercel.app).

**The Evidence (So Far):**
- **+465 iRating** in 6 weeks (1238 → 1703) — **Top 0.38%** of 33,817 drivers
- **P130 overall** with 99.6% points percentile (outperforming rating by 9 percentile points)
- **Sequential Mastery framework** producing 97% corner improvement in a single day
- **17-minute focused practice sessions** outperforming hour-long scattered training
- **Voice-telemetry correlation** (EXP-02) validating verbal self-cueing → automatic execution
- **7 AI race victories** applying learned techniques under pressure
- **10/10 corners dialed** at Summit Point after 3 days of focused work

**What We're Proving:**
- AI + data + personalized frameworks = accelerated learning
- ADHD-adapted communication (short sessions, clear focus, emotional engagement) works measurably
- Sequential Mastery > scattered practice
- Conversational AI can coach complex motor skills when given proper tools and context
- Partnership between human intuition and AI analysis unlocks capabilities neither could achieve alone

All tracked, documented, validated, reproducible. 🏎️🔬

## Week 07: The Click (Summit Point Main Circuit)

There's a moment when everything stops feeling hard. When the track that fought you yesterday suddenly feels like home. When the corner that was a lottery becomes a weapon.

Master Lonn found that moment at Summit Point.

He returned after seven months away, expecting rust. Instead, his first lap was 1.4 seconds faster than his old PB. The growth from Weeks 01-06 had compounded into something he couldn't see until he was back on familiar ground.

But that was just the beginning. The first session revealed two nemesis corners—Turn 1 and the Carousel—accounting for 88% of all rotation events. The gap to P4 (Shuning Gong) was 1.1 seconds. Not talent. *Commitment*.

Day two, seventeen minutes changed everything.

He walked into the session with two focus areas: T5 coasting (no trail braking into the Carousel) and T1 late braking (full commitment after the three cones). No chasing lap times. No heroics. Just deliberate, focused drilling.

The data came back: 59% oversteer reduction at T5. Automaticity forming at T1. PB matched without trying.

That evening, exhausted, he did a "flow session"—just drive, have fun, see what stuck. Twenty-five minutes of rallycross-mode shenanigans. The result? **NEW PB: 1:15.550**. The morning's technique work had bedded in during play. Speed came as byproduct.

Day three brought the races. The morning was chaos—contact at Lap 2, off-track at Lap 3, dropped from P1 to P8. He recovered to P2, setting his fastest lap on the final lap. Voice recording captured his mental journey: frustration → acceptance → focus → confidence.

But the evening session was where it clicked.

Started on pole. Got passed by faster AI—*didn't fight it* (Meebewegen 2.0). Chased. Caught. Then, at T5, the corner he'd drilled two days earlier, he saw his moment. He carried speed through the apex, got better drive, and made a clean pass to take the lead.

The adaptive AI sped up. With two minutes left, the #8 car slipstreamed past and reclaimed P1.

Master Lonn's final lap? **1:15.800**. Only 0.25s off his practice PB. In a race. While chasing.

He finished P2. But the data told a different story: **10 out of 10 corners dialed**. Turn 1, which had been a 2.626-second lottery that morning, was now 0.087 seconds consistent. A 97% improvement in *one day*.

The voice recording proved what the telemetry couldn't see. "No trail braking," he said four times during the race. Carousel Entry brake point σ: 1.9 meters—the same spot within two meters across ten laps of intense racing. Verbal self-cueing becoming automatic execution.

This wasn't luck. This was the result of focused practice → flow consolidation → race deployment. The learning cycle that Week 05-06 built, weaponized.

When the adaptive AI had to speed up to beat him, it wasn't a loss. It was validation.

## The Journey So Far

### Week 06: The Lesson (Oran Park)

Oran Park was supposed to be simple. Learn a new track. Race clean. Bank points.

Instead, Master Lonn learned what separates fast drivers from championship drivers: knowing when to walk away.

Four consecutive practice PBs. 1.55 seconds dropped in three days. Champion Curve mastered (92% improvement). Foster's Dip technique self-discovered—light brakes before the compression, trust the 3.3G load, let physics do the work.

Then came race day. Four races in five hours. Race 03 was perfect: P7 finish, 67 championship points, 0.796s σ (ELITE), resilience proven. **That was the week score.**

But he didn't stop. Race 04 cost iRating and gained nothing. The lesson: *Know When To Stop*.

### Week 05: The Hotel's Revenge (Oschersleben)

T2 Hotel Exit—a decreasing radius downhill corner that snapped the rear and cost race wins. Five AI races. Three potential victories lost to one corner.

He went back to the lab. Reverse-engineered the aliens. Found the technique: 20% throttle hold through the apex to stabilize the rear.

In the final official race, on no sleep, starting P10, he drove through the field. T2 was mastered (σ 0.153s). The Achilles heel was dead.

### Week 04: The Ninja (Lime Rock Park)

From "No Clue" to Top Split Podium.

The breakthrough came from Edge Mapping—finding the spatial limits at 70% pace, then deploying at 100%. S3 consistency improved 56%. In the Top Split (SoF 2035), when a faster driver attacked, he deployed Meebewegen. Let them through. Stayed clean. P3 podium. Ninja > Barbarian.

### Week 03: The Robot (Winton)

Master Lonn became a metronome. 1:25.710. Consistency σ 0.16s. He won by being so relentlessly consistent that opponents crashed trying to keep up.

This was the week of the Cold Tire Contract: survive Laps 1-2, attack from Lap 3. It became the foundation of his racecraft.

### Week 02: The Rust (Rudskogen)

Six months away. The rust was real. T2 was a disaster.

But he chipped away at it. Found the "50 sign" brake marker. Beat his July PB by 0.4s. Scored a Top 500 global ranking time.

The lesson: Strategic Maturity. In a chaotic race, he recognized "P3 is secured," backed off 5%, and brought the car home.

### Week 01: The Beginning (Jefferson)

He arrived running 51.4s, scared of the walls. He left running 50.5s, with a race victory and a podium.

The discovery of Flow State. "Easy flying." The realization that trying less means going faster.

## The Driver

**Master Lonn** isn't just fast. He's a **Systems Thinker**.

He doesn't just drive laps; he builds protocols. The *Cold Tire Contract*. The *Position Secured Protocol*. The *Pit Crew Protocol*. The *Sequential Mastery Framework*.

He has ADHD, which means his brain craves novelty but struggles with impulse. The systems are the guardrails. When the red mist descends, the protocol takes over.

He's learned that **Success** (P137, 67 points) is different from **Satisfaction** ("I wanted P1"). He's learned that **Resilience** (resetting after a crash in one lap) is worth more than raw speed.

He's learned that **increments getting smaller** doesn't mean growth stopping—it means reaching the next phase. The gains from "stop crashing" are done. Now it's fractions of seconds against people who've been doing this for years.

He is currently ranked **Top 0.44%** globally. And after Week 07, he's not wondering if he's still growing.

He knows.
