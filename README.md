## The Story So Far

### Week 06: From Lottery to Laser (Oran Park)

The track bit first.

Champion Curve—blind entry, climbing, tightening—didn't ask if Master Lonn belonged on Day 1. It told him he didn't. Multiple offs. Multiple spins. A 3-second swing at one corner that could eject you or give you a clean exit depending on which version of luck you brought.

And yet: Lap 14, **1:12.583**. Five seconds faster than Lap 1. After the drama.

Two days later, he came back with a mission: conquer Champion Curve.

Champion Curve Entry went from 0.898s variance (lottery) to **0.072s** (laser). That's **92% improvement**. Champion Curve Exit? Work-needed to **0.052s dialed** with 0.2-meter apex precision. The Week 06 goal was "σ < 0.4s." He achieved 0.072s. That's **82% better than the target**.

The result? **1:11.617**. NEW PERSONAL BEST. **0.966 seconds** faster.

But speed has a price when you're hunting the limit. Foster's Dip—a compound corner with compression and elevation—sent him spinning twice. The consistency suffered. The pace, though? Only **0.217s** from theoretical optimal. He'd found the edge.

You can't discover the limit without falling off it a few times.

**Week 06 Status**: **🏆 1:11.617 NEW PB** | Champion Curve MASTERED | Gap to Gong: 2.0s | Next: Foster's Dip chaos

---

### Week 05: The Achilles Heel Dies at Hotel (Oschersleben)

There's a corner at Oschersleben that doesn't negotiate.

T2 Hotel Exit—a long, decreasing-radius, downhill right-hander where GR86 muscle memory goes to die. Master Lonn arrived knowing the track from his GT86 days. What he didn't know was that the FF1600 speaks an entirely different language.

Session 2 revealed the monster. Three incidents. Lap times swinging by seven seconds. Variance at one corner: **2.257 seconds**. A lottery. A coin flip. The difference between a 1:33 and a 1:40.

_"I remember that being a strange corner from my GR86 times,"_ he admitted. Strange was an understatement.

Over three days, consistency-first methodology carved away at the chaos. The variance dropped—90%, then 97%. By AI Race 02, T2 was **DIALED**: σ 0.066s. A PB followed: **1:32.933**, set while defending for four laps.

Then came the revenge.

Three consecutive AI races where T2 cost potential wins. POLE to P10—punted on the final lap. P6→P2 twice—both times the Hotel bit when he was fighting for the lead. The pattern was undeniable: practice T2 was mastered; race T2 under pressure was a lottery.

But on January 11th, testing wheelbase settings—not even trying to go fast—something clicked. **1:32.907.** And more importantly, the words for what his hands had discovered:

> _"20% gas until I can exit... slowly on the gas to 100."_

Never fully off throttle through the apex. The rear stays planted. The snap disappears.

---

Race day arrived stacked against him. Almost no sleep. Qualifying disaster—two offs at Hotel, P10 on the grid. **Top split. SoF 1828.** Surrounded by drivers rated 156 points higher.

Lap 6: **1:32.700.** NEW PB. Mid-race. On no sleep. In top split.

Then Lap 7—contact at Hotel. 5x. The lap exploded. But Lap 8? 1:33.8. Recovery. Composure. **P5.**

_"One off track... hmm I'm a little drama queen..."_ he admitted, falling asleep.

---

Two days later, rested but not quite sharp, he returned for one more. P7 grid, top split again. The mantra: _meebewegen, keep calm, flow._

The race unfolded like a statement. Watched erratic drivers crash and burn. Kept distance. Stayed clean.

And T2? **σ 0.153s.** Solid. In traffic. Under race pressure.

The Achilles heel was dead.

**P4. Zero incidents.** +35 iRating. The technique wasn't just discovered—it had become muscle memory.

**Week 05 Final**: 1:32.700 PB | P5 + P4 Official (both Top Split) | +66 iR | **14/14 corners dialed** | T2 MASTERED | Championship P106 (top 0.4%)

---

### Week 04: From "No Clue" to Top Split Podium (Lime Rock Park)

The week didn't start with confidence. It started with T5.

_"I have no clue how to take T5 properly."_

That was January 1st. The Uphill at Lime Rock—a fast right over a crest—was pure chaos. S3 consistency: 1.075 seconds.

**Chapter 16 changed everything.** Spatial Awareness written that morning. Edge Mapping Drill at 70% pace. Three hours later: S3 dropped to 0.183s σ. New PB: 56.238s. Through T5—the chaos corner—he was now **1.87 km/h FASTER than series leader Shuning Gong.**

Then came the real test: SoF 2035. A faster car caught him mid-race. The old Master Lonn might have fought. The new one opened the door.

**P3. Zero incidents. +71 iRating.**

_"Being strategic like a ninja is way more effective and calm."_

---

### Week 03: The Robot Awakens (Winton National)

Winton is a tight, technical serpent that punishes impatience. Master Lonn didn't just learn it—he dissected it.

The Cold Tire Contract was born here. Survive L1-L3 at 80%, attack L4+. First attempt: P11→P1.

The official race? Qualified P3, took P1, watched leaders push too hard and spin. He just kept hitting 1:26s. Like a metronome.

**First Official Victory.** 1601 iRating—the 1.5k barrier shattered.

---

### Week 02: The Battle of the Hill (Rudskogen)

Six months away. Rudskogen's downhill came rushing at him—faster than memory.

Two days of struggle. Then the rhythm clicked. Not on the stopwatch—in his hands.

**1:28.508.** Beating his July ghost by nearly two seconds.

---

### Week 01: The Awakening (Summit Point Jefferson)

Chaos. Survival. Turn 1 crashes filtering out the aggressive.

The discovery: you can't force speed. In the final laps, a 50.768s emerged that felt effortless.

When the mind quiets, the car flies.

---

## The Breakthrough Moments

**Week 01**: Flow State discovered. Speed comes from letting go.  
**Week 02**: 1:28.508. The rust is gone.  
**Week 03**: 1601 iR. First Official Victory. Cold Tire Contract born.  
**Week 04**: Chapter 16 → 3 hours → Beating Gong through T5. P3 Top Split podium.  
**Week 05**: T2 Hotel conquered. **1:32.700 PB.** Two Top Split finishes. **T2 MASTERED in race conditions.**  
**Week 06**: Alien comparison reveals the truth—2.7s gap lives in corner speed, not straights. The Sweeper exposed.

---

## The Philosophy

**1. Consistency-First Produces Speed**  
Focus on hitting the same marks. The PBs come anyway.

**2. The "Meebewegen" Strategy**  
In chaos, don't fight the current. Move with it. Strike when the gap opens.

**3. The Cold Tire Contract v2.0**  
Six wins, three tracks. Survive L1-L3. Attack L4+.

**4. The Hotel Rule**  
Don't fight for P1 at contested corners. Attack elsewhere.

**5. The 20% Throttle Hold**  
On downhill decreasing-radius corners, never fully off throttle through the apex.

**6. Ninja > Barbarian**  
Patient races = wins. Aggressive race = punted.

**7. Trust the Systems**  
Feeling "awful" and performing well are not mutually exclusive.

## What's Next

**Week 06 continues**: [Oran Park Raceway – Grand Prix](./weeks/week06/README.md) 🦜  
Baseline established. Alien dissected. Now the real work begins.

**Priority 1**: The Sweeper — LIFT, don't brake. Carry 160+ km/h.  
**Priority 2**: Champion Curve — Later apex, trust the grip.  
**Priority 3**: Momo Corner — Hidden 11 km/h loss exposed.

**Target**: Break **1:11.0** by fixing The Sweeper alone.

---

The Hotel has been checked out. The Achilles heel is dead. Now an alien named Gong is showing Master Lonn exactly where 2.7 seconds lives.

96.3% of the lap is red. Time to paint it green.

_"Tricky track with, eh, ups and downs. I think in time I'll get the hang of it though... Fun track."_ 🦜

**The hunt begins.** 🎯
